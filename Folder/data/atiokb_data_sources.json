Pioneer in transformative action for SLM, the Network establishes an innovative space for sharing and scaling good practices to address land degradation, climate change, and biodiversity loss. This facilitates local, national, regional and global knowledge sharing and analysis of which good practices work where, how and why, and what are their costs and benefits.\u0026nbsp; Due to its long-term presence and wealth of knowledge, the [WOCAT Global SLM Database] has been officially recognized by the UNCCD as the primary recommended Global Database for SLM best practices. WOCAT\u2019s role in documenting and sharing of SLM good practices, building capacities and supporting the implementation of UNCCD has been highlighted by the [five UNCCD COP15 decisions](https:\/\/www.wocat.net\/library\/media\/265\/) that specifically relate to and mention WOCAT.\nThe main\u0026nbsp;WOCAT services include:\n\nGlobal Network of SLM specialists, forming partnerships, and maximizing synergies\nStandardised way to document SLM knowledge and host of a user-friendly database\nTools to assess SLM solutions to promote their wide adoption and spread\nTraining and capacity building in SLM\nDissemination of targeted information via different channels ensuring strong knowledge flow related to SLM\nSearching and selecting SLM options: decision support for mainstreaming and scaling out SLM\nMapping problems and progress: spatial assessment of land degradation and SLM in the context of Land Degradation Neutrality\n\nWOCAT took the lead in moving away from land degradation towards a SLM focus. WOCAT defines SLM as:\n\u0022the use of land resources, including soils, water, animals and plants, for the production of goods to meet changing human needs, while simultaneously ensuring the long-term productive potential of these resources and the maintenance of their environmental functions.\u0022 (Learn more)\u0026nbsp;\nWOCAT unites stakeholders for transformative actions towards a future where knowledge is mobilized to fight degradation, ensure land is on the global agenda, and sustainable practices are successfully taken up \u2013 benefitting people and nature.\n","field_use_cases_description":""}]
