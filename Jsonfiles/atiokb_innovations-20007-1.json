Due to conflicts between Burkina and Mali it was ruined in 1976, and then again in 1985. In 1996 the National Office for Wells and Boreholes (ONFP), a government agency, rehabilitated the well and made two supplementary boreholes. The complex consists of a main well with an operating flow rate of 120 m3\/h, having a submersible pump of brand KSB, type OPA 150s-65\/8, and a pump capacity of 60 m3\/h. Next to the main well there is a secondary well, which is equipped with a hand-operated pump with a capacity of 18 m3\/h.\nThe energy for pumping water from the wells is provided by a generator with an engine of brand DEUTZ (type: F3 - 6L 912) and a switch of brand LEROY SOMER \u2013 Type LSA 42.1 L8L C1\/4, a voltage of 400 V and continuous power of 50 kW. The generator has a switch and a battery. A diesel tank with a volume of approximately 9 m3 was installed for the power supply to the generator. The pumped water is stored in an elevated water tank, which is located at a distance of about 200 m from the well, and has a volume of 50 m3. The water from the elevated water tank is distributed to four artificial ponds with a dimension of 50 m x 50 m x 1.5 m at equal distances on all sides of the central reservoir.  The water is conducted to the artificial ponds through PVC piping, which is buried underground over a distance of 8 km, or 2 km for each pond. The water flow is controlled by nine valves of  type Nr. 4000, Reg. Nr. W 1.129, installed on the pipes. The hydraulic complex was installed in 1996 by the National Agency for Water and Sanitation (ONEA). The complex is managed by the livestock keepers through the User Association of \u0027Forage Christine\u0027 (AUFC). The statutes of this organisation were adopted on 2 May 2014. The well is managed according to a set of requirements which specify the terms for access to water: date of opening and closure of the well, the amount to be paid per animal and the management of the cash money provided.\n\u0027Forage Christine\u0027 is a major water infrastructure, established in the northern part of the Sahel region in Burkina Faso between longitude 0\u00b045\u2019W and latitude 14\u00b048\u2019N, providing drinking water to herds within an area of 100 to 300 km from its central location between Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. It was established in 1971 in the context of major droughts that had affected the Sahel, and it was opened for the first time in 1972. It is located in the middle of the Sahel region of Burkina Faso, at two km from the pond of Tin-Arkachen in the department of D\u00e9ou, at approximately 45 km from the capital of the department, and 85 km from Gorom-Gorom. At the sub-regional level, the well is a around ten km from the border with Mali, and at 100 km from the border with Niger. The climate is of Sahelian type, and has a rainy season of 3 to 4 months (from June-July to September), which is subject to strong temporal and spatial variations in precipitation, and a dry season of 8 to 9 months. The climatic conditions are characterized by highly irregular winds, precipitation, evapotranspiration and moisture due to fluctuations in atmospheric circulation patterns. Annual precipitation is around 500 mm on average, with roughly 30 rainy days, and is marked by significant inter-annual variations. The stream network of the region consists of several streams, with one permanent river: B\u00e9li. To this river, ponds and many depressions are connected, which disappear after the month of January. The soils are very diverse in general, and mostly of sandy texture. They do not provide a good medium for plant growth due to the low permeability, which reduces water infiltration. Therefore water availability appears to be one of the major limitations for rainfed agriculture, in addition to the limited retention and availability of nutrients. According to the phytogeographic division of Burkina Faso (Fontes and Guinko, 1995), the area of \u0027Forage Christine\u0027 is situated in the  northern or strict Sahelian phytogeographic sector. This sector is characterized by a set of typical Saharan and Sahelian vegetation species which mainly occur in shrub and woody steppes (48.85%) and grassy steppes (24.37%), which form the larger part of the rangelands (***). This vegetation provides the most important natural grazing land to livestock.\nWith regard to the human environment, the last General Population and Housing Census mentions a population of 25321 inhabitants for the municipality of D\u00e9ou. Yet this number varies significantly due to the seasonal migration of people from other regions to use water and forage resources.  The ethnic groups in the region are mainly Fulb\u00e9, Kurumba, Songhai, Tuareg, Mossi and Hausa people.\nEconomic activities in the region are livestock keeping, farming, craftmanship, fishing, trade, tourism and hunting. Several socio-economic groups are guiding these activities. Some 60 farmer groups, 53 groups of livestock keepers, six of which for female livestock keepers, and three organisations for environmental protection. With regard to infrastructure for education, sanitation and socio-economical conditions, the municipality of D\u00e9ou has three markets, 18 schools, one middle school, 47 permanent functional literacy centers (CPAF), one recreation center, six cereal banks, three healthcare and welfare centers (CSPS), three medical stores, one tourist camp and one financial institution.\nFarming and livestock keeping continue to be the most important socio-economic activities. The agricultural crops produced include millet, sorghum, maize, cowpea, rice and groundnut. In 2009, a total area of 345.5 ha was sown for these crops. The Sahel region in Burkina Faso has excellent conditions for livestock keeping. The animal species found in the region are mainly cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, camels, donkeys and horses and poultry. Several facilities and installations for water supply to pastoral areas are available in the region, as well as storage facilities for agricultural and agro-industrial by-products (SPAI) and infrastructure for trade and animal health care. The municipality of D\u00e9ou disposes of one reservoir, five artificial ponds, 43 firm wells, ten vaccination centers, one store for agricultural and agro-industrial by-products (SPAI), one animal shelter, a facility for slaughtering and a livestock market.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe infrastructure was created in 1971, but the facilities for use were installed in 1996.\nThe well is located in the municipality of D\u00e9ou, but is used for livestock from the entire Sahel region in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.In addition to livestock keeping, subsistence farming is practiced. The main crops are sorghum, millet, groundnut and cowpea. The size of the fields varies between 0.5 and 3 ha. The farm type is family-based.\nAnimal species: cattle, sheep, camels, donkeys and goats.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"1.

It comprises alternating different types of crops, usually in a specific order. Crop rotation maintains soil fertility, reduces the risk of diseases and pests, and optimizes nutrient utilization. In Slovenia, a 5-year rotation is proving especially effective.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Gregor KrambergerCrop rotation is a system of alternating arable crops, forage plants, aromatic herbs, and vegetables, generally in a specific sequence. It can be applied in fields, gardens, or enclosed growing spaces. Crop rotation is adaptable and can be used under different farming systems, such as organic, integrated, and conventional farming. It maximises the efficiency of biological, organizational, and spatial influences on soil and plants. The fundamental element of crop rotation is the selection of plant species that are most effectively alternated on the same piece of land over different years. To ensure the best selection, it is essential to understand the farming technology, the type and structure of the soil, and its nutrient composition.\nBy implementing good crop rotation, nutrient utilization is optimized, and the risk of diseases and pests is reduced. Crop rotation also ensures the sustainable use of soil by improving its structure and fertility. The inclusion of cover crops in a rotation helps to maintain continuous soil cover. Crop rotation also facilitates better adaptation to climate change (drought, hail, floods etc), depending on the plants included in the rotation. The inclusion of green manure crops and the use of organic fertilizers can reinforce crop rotation and further support soil fertility enhancement and conservation.\nTo establish and maintain crop rotation, a detailed plan must be prepared, including the selection of crops based on soil characteristics, nutrient requirements, and crop sequencing needs. A fertilization plan should also be developed in parallel. It is crucial to ensure appropriate agricultural machinery, especially for specialty crops, and to have sufficient labour available, as more complex rotations may increase workload. Additionally, market research for new crops and demand assessment should be conducted.\nIn summary, crop rotation offers numerous benefits:\n- Enhances soil fertility and improves soil structure.\n- Reduces diseases, pests, and weeds.\n- Minimises nutrient leaching and soil erosion.\n- Increases organic matter content in the soil.\n- Boosts biodiversity and strengthens soil resilience to weather changes.\n- Enables efficient resource utilization and reduces production costs.\nThus, crop rotation offers numerous benefits that farmers appreciate \u2013 all of which help ensure higher and more sustainable yields. However, this technology requires specific knowledge, precise planning, and careful scheduling, which increases the complexity of production. It also demands more labour and sometimes additional machinery, leading to higher production costs. Furthermore, marketing various crops requires careful consideration, which can pose a challenge for farmers.\nCrop rotation in Slovenia is supported by Agri-Environmental-Climate Payments (CAP), which enables farmers to receive funding for implementing a diverse and effective crop rotation system. \nAn effective 5-year rotation system in Slovenia typically follows the following sequence:\n1st year \u2013 flowering grass mixture\n2nd \u2013 winter barley\n3rd \u2013 grain maize\n4th \u2013 wheat\n5th \u2013 oil pumpkins\nThis ensures that at least three different annual crops are grown within the five years, while integrating legumes like alfalfa or red clover every 3\u20134 years to enrich soil nitrogen levels. Cereals may appear up to three times in the rotation, but never in consecutive years. After cereal crops the farmer may alternatively sow non-winter-hardy honey-producing cover crops. Despite this structured guidance, many rotations in Slovenia remain too narrow. National laws and guidelines for agri-environmental measures support farmers in designing good crop sequences.\nCOMMENTS:\nIn the case study area of Pesnica, OPTAIN project.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"1.

Low-cost polyhouses can be used to protect crops from excessive rainfall and can provide a sheltered environment for the production of better quality crops over the rainy season cropping period. For example, smallholder farmers who produce high demand vegetables such as tomatoes can earn as much as USD 350\u2013500 from a plot of land which measures only 100 m2 in area over the short time period from June to November. This is much more than they can earn by growing any traditional crop by conventional methods. The Sustainable Soil Management Programme (SSMP) is promoting this technology in several mid-hill districts of Nepal.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Polyhouses should be situated in well-drained areas where sunshine is abundant and there is no shade throughout the cropping period. The bamboo frame can be constructed earlier in the year but the plastic roofing is not added until after one or two rainfall events. The height of the polyhouse frame varies depending on the altitude. At higher elevations, the polyhouses are lower to help trap more heat and moisture, whereas at lower elevations the polyhouses are higher to allow more air to circulate and moisture to evaporate. The preparations, which take place mid-May to early June, consist of fertilizing the soil and planting the tomato seedlings. Throughout the growing season the tomato plants are staked, trained, and pruned and a top dressing of fertilizer is added to produce a higher quality product.\nCOMMENTS:\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): In the mid-hills of Nepal, the arable land of most farm households has been divided into very small plots. If this land is used to produce traditional crops such as maize, wheat, and millet using conventional farming methods, it cannot provide full employment for all of the householders and cannot yield sufficient cash income for the household. The risk of intense rainfall during the monsoon season, which can damage crops, has prevented these farmers from switching to more lucrative high value crops.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"","type_id":"","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"1.

Only 7% is produced domestically. However, in the Colombian Orinoquia there is a potential area of 500,000 hectares which could help meet this demand.\nThe Corpoica Guayuriba 9 variety was developed at the La Libertad research center as a genetic alternative for soybean cultivation in the Colombian Orinoquia region. It is an intermediate cycle material with 105 days to harvest, determinate growth habits, white flowers, and cream-colored seeds. Its potential grain yield is up to 3.0 t\/ha. This variety offers comparative advantages such as a higher number of pods per plant (45), seed weight of 15 g, high oil protein content, and tolerance to leaf diseases and other viral complexes. \nCorpoica Guayuriba 9 is an economically viable and environmentally sustainable alternative, due to its excellent association with bacteria of the Bradyrhizobium genus for symbiotic nitrogen fixation, contributing to the improvement of the rotation system with cereals, such as rice-soybean-corn-soybean, helping build up nutrients in the soil. This allows rationalization in the use of nitrogen fertilizers in each crop cycle, reduces production costs, and increases yields.\nIn addition, it is a very important source of raw material for the production of balanced feed because of its high content of protein, amino acids, and essential fatty acids for the production of animal concentrates and human food with high protein values.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|animal production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 909, 910, 915, 916, 921, 922, 899","readiness_level":"9.

This innovation is a key contribution within the Water-Energy-Food Nexus, addressing the unique challenges of food production in the Middle East.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Joren VerbistAchieving food production and food security in the Middle East is challenging due to the region\u0027s arid climate. Net houses and greenhouses offer potential solutions by improving water efficiency and providing better climate control. However, traditional greenhouses require substantial water and energy inputs. This challenge is directly linked to the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus, which offers integrated solutions to these interconnected needs.\nIn 2022, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) began experimenting with various greenhouse models in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to develop an optimal WEF solution. The outcome of these experiments is a water- and energy-efficient \u201cnet house\u201d with several advantages.\nOne major issue with conventional greenhouses is their high water use due to the inefficiency of traditional soil bed systems. ICARDA\u2019s research highlighted that simplified closed soil-less production systems can reduce irrigation water needs by more than 50%. These systems also offer additional benefits, including shorter cropping cycles, no risk of soil degradation or contamination, higher resource efficiency, and lower operational costs, as they eliminate the need for sterilization, soil cultivation, base fertilizers, and weed control.\nTraditional greenhouses typically use pads and fans for cooling, but these systems have significant drawbacks. They are costly, require frequent maintenance and replacements, and consume a large amount of electricity. It\u0027s also noteworthy that most Gulf countries have recently increased their electricity prices. One approach to reducing cooling needs is to use a net house instead of a traditional greenhouse, combined with ventilators.\nAnother factor contributing to high energy consumption in traditional greenhouses is the use of conventional drip irrigation systems. In collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), ICARDA researched energy-efficient drip irrigation systems, leading to the development of Ultra Low Energy (ULE) drippers. These drippers reduce pumping energy by 80%, which in turn lowers the number of solar panels required, making the system more cost-effective.\nThe efficient WEF Nexus solution proposed by ICARDA comprises five key technologies:\n1.Closed soil-less production system: A hydroponic system with fertigation.\n2.Net house: A structure that allows airflow while protecting crops from insects and adverse weather.\n3.Ultra-low pressure irrigation system\n4.Root zone cooling: In soil-less systems, cooling the root zone is easier and more cost-effective through ventilation.\n5.Low-cost solar energy: The rapid decline in the cost of solar panels enhances the system\u0027s affordability.\nThis case study focuses on irrigation and fertigation solar powered solution with a Hybrid AC\/DC root zone cooling. It is hybrid, which implies that there are no batteries to keep the house running at night and when sunshine is insufficient, it takes electricity from the grid. Compared to conventional cooled greenhouses, the net house measuring 8x30 meters offer multiple benefits compared with traditional greenhouses:\n\u2022Energy savings of 80% to 90%\n\u2022Extended production periods without any reduction in yield or quality\n\u2022Signi\ufb01cantly lower costs\n\u2022Dramatically improved water productivity\n\u2022A 14% increase in net returns and a 28% reduction in costs.\nThis innovation demonstrates the e\ufb00ectiveness and necessity of integrated Water-Energy-Food strategies and contributes to a more water, energy, and food-secure Middle East.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|optimization of resource use for better production|climate change adaptation|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact|Farm management|field management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 920, 909, 918, 925, 910, 914","readiness_level":"7.

Die Neigung \u00fcber die Untersuchungsfl\u00e4che ist nahezu null Grad. Es ist im Norden der Parzelle eine leicht konkave Struktur zu erkennen. In dieser Senke hat der Landwirt wiederholt mit derart Stauwasser zu k\u00e4mpfen, dass er betr\u00e4chtliche Ernteausf\u00e4lle einb\u00fcsst. Der Landwirt bepflanzt die Parzelle mit einer Zuckerr\u00fcbe-Kartoffel-Getreide-Bohnen Fruchtfolge. Diese wird teilweise durch eine Gr\u00fcnd\u00fcngung erg\u00e4nzt. Sein Anbausystem ist gepr\u00e4gt durch die Drainage zur Entw\u00e4sserung der B\u00f6den. Diese bewirken erst die Nutzung des Landes als Kulturland und sind daher essentiell f\u00fcr das Funktionieren des Systems. Trotzdem k\u00f6nnen sie die angesprochene Problematik in der Senke nicht vollends l\u00f6sen. F\u00fcr die Bepflanzung der Kulturen verwendet der Landwirt verschiedene Maschinen.

The technology is among a list of basket of choices of SLM practices recently introduced and adapted to the area by land user and experts working with SCC-Vi Agroforestry an NGO contracted\/outsourced by the Tras-boundary Agro-ecosystem Management Project  (Kagera TAMP) for provision of SLM advisory and extension services.\nContour bunds are constructed across the sloppy landscapes of average slope 5 \u2013 8 % and are arranged in rows from the top to the bottom of the slope. The average distance between contour bunds is 15 meters. A contour bund is a row of long narrow furrow of average width 90cm and average depth 30cm dug across the slope using simple tools and leveled using A-frame method. Dug soils are piled below the slope to form a long strip earth of fanya chini bund. The average height and width of a bund is 30cm and 45cm respectively. Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) are planted on contour bund to make them more stronger and productive. A single stand of pigeon pea has two plants and the distance between stands is 30 cm. Improved cassavas (Manihot esculenta) variety (mkombozi) that are resistant to cassava mosaic virus are planted in rows between contour bunds. Within rows, the space between cassavas is 1meter and between rows is 1meter. Manure application is applied before cassava planting at the rate of 2kgs per each plant hole. Cassava is usually planted on May and is harvested after one year. Cassava is planted together with groundnuts (Arachis hypogea) as a cover crop. Despite of having the nutritional advantage to farmers, pigeon pea and groundnuts also diversifies farmers\u2019 livelihood income and have a key role of improving ecosystem through soil water conservation (prevent unproductive loss of green water) and improve soil fertility (through soil nutrient replenishment) and their after harvest remains are sources of organic matter.\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of the technology is to:\n1) Increase cassava productivity 2) Improved livelihood of the rural poor through diversification of income sources (cajanus cajan, groundnuts and cassava) and 3) conserve and restore ecosystem through soil fertility improvement (replacement of nutrients lost through uptake by plants), soil moisture improvement (by preventing blue water loss through runoff and green water loss through unproductive evaporation) and control of cassava pests and diseases (use of cassava varieties that are  resistant to cassava mosaic virus).\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Establishment activities include land preparation, ploughing and harrowing, contour bund construction and leveling using A-frame, manure procurement and application. Maintenance and recurrent activities involves collection of cassava planting materials and planting, vegetative stabilization of the bunds by planting Cajanus cajan, planting of cover crops (groundnuts  within cassava farm), weeding\/gap filling and harvesting.\nNatural \/ human environment: The natural environment includes crop land dominated with separate annual crops. A combination of structural and vegetative measure (contour bund strengthened and made more productive with Cajanus cajan). Climatic zone is sub humid with 210 length of growing period (LGP). Slope category is moderate lying between 5-8%. Soil texture is gravel sandy loam with medium soil depth.\nOn human environment, mechanization is dominated by use of handy tools and occasional use of tractors. Production system is mixed (both for subsistence and commercial purposes). Inputs used includes tools (hand hoe, machete, sickles, spade and mattock), light and heavy labour, manure, seeds and cassava planting materials with average annual costs of 1033.47 USD per hectare. Land ownership is individual not titles. The expected average annual gross revenue per hectare accrued from cassava alone is 20580 USD.\nCOMMENTS:\nSLM technology was applied in the area under FFS training and partially adopted to some individual farmers fields (FFS members).Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soil erosion caused by rainfall water runoff, low soil fertility due to excessive nutrient plant uptake without replenishment and moisture water stress.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Soil erosion, low moisture and low crop productivity.\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: cropping system is largely dominated with annual and perennial cropping and there is also some patches of agroforestry (largely fruit trees like avocados and mangoes).\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"United Republic of Tanzania","country_origin_od":"498","region":"Africa","region_id":"102","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"Academia and researchers, Farmers\u0026#039; associations, Agriculture cooperatives, Rural communities, Indigenous communities, Large size farms \/ farmers, Medium size farms \/ farmers, Smallholder farms \/ farmers, Farm advisors, Large enterprises, Small-medium enterprises, Small-micro entrepreneurs, Civil society organizations, Food consumers, Central government entities, Local government entities, International organizations, Funders and investors, Consortium of partners","prospective_users_id":"1, 2, 3, 4, 2074, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 2075, 17","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"SCC-Vi Agroforestry","partner_text":"Trans-boundary Agro-ecosystem Management Project, SCC-Vi Agroforestry","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"9","id":"33954","title":"Adapted management of organic soils","short_description":"Re-wetting of organic soils and following adapted management suitable for wet conditions like extensive grazing land or paludiculture.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Johanna FickIn peat lands, formed over centuries, reducing the ground water level leads to min-eralization: this results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and leaching of dis-solved organic nutrients into adjacent water bodies. Furthermore, drainage leads to the destruction of highly specialized ecosystems. Re-wetting, by removing of drain-age systems (etc.), means the restoration of a higher ground water level which can reduce GHG emissions in the long term. Re-wetting to a water-level of 10 cm below the soil surface is ideal for reducing GHG emissions and preventing peat mineraliza-tion. One prerequisite for re-wetting is that soil degradation and peat mineralization are not too advanced. An adequate water supply must be available. Re-wetting also affects adjacent areas so possible impacts such as flooding of settlements and in-frastructure must be considered.\nPurpose of the Technology: Land uses suitable for the soil conditions after re-wetting are extensive grazing, or paludiculture. Paludiculture is the cultivation of wet organic soils by preserving or renewing peat by planting and harvesting specific trees (e.g. alder), reeds and sedges. On fens, alder trees (for wood \/biomass production) or plant species grown for their products (e.g. for thatch) or bioenergy, including the common reed, reed canary grass or cat\u2019s-tail, can be cultivated. On peat bogs sphagnum farming as a peat substitute in horticulture, or as a medicinal plant, is possible. The first harvest of the common reed can take place four years post-establishment; thereafter annually. Alternatively, extensive livestock grazing with water buffalo or suitable breeds of cattle like Galloway or Heck has potential for re-wetted land. Year-round grazing is possible with a carrying capacity of up to 0.7 livestock units\/ha.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Apart from avoiding huge amounts of GHG emissions and bringing land into alter-native production, further aims of re-wetting and adapting land use are:\n-soil protection (soil structure, water content, peat protection);\n-water protection (water quality, buffering \/ filtering water);\n-protection of the landscape\u2019s water regime and material balance (solute transport);\n-biodiversity protection (retaining a sensitive ecosystem with specialized\/ threatened species); and\n-flood protection (organic soils can quickly absorb large amount of water).\nThere are many advantages for the environment while still creating a (modest) in-come for land users. Unlike most other bioenergy production chains (e.g. maize, rapeseed) which do not have these environmental co-benefits, paludiculture with the common reed can become a sustainable production system.\nNatural \/ human environment: The Altmark region is located on the North German Plain. The region is predomi-nantly characterized by agriculture but has many forests too. Because of the high proportion of grassland, cattle are important. The use of biomass for bioenergy was increasing and many biogas plants were established in the last few years. Fens are mostly located in Altmark-County Salzwedel. Here, the average population density (42.7 inhabitants km2) is relatively low in the German context and the annual precipi-tation of 466mm is also below the overall German average.\nCOMMENTS:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 288 km2.\nPotential area: 288 km2 (~ 6% of the region). The area stated is the area that is potentially usable for the technology due to available geographical data; requirements: fen (Nieder- und Anmoor), area under agricultural land use, outside of nature protection areas (national parc, nature reserve, FFH area, SPA area, Ramsar).

The goals of the project were the improvement of the livelihoods of local farmers and the establishment of a farming system that is self-sufficient and thus needs no external inputs. SRI is not a recipe to be followed step by step, but general ideas that need to be adapted to the local conditions. These basic ideas are the following:\n- Early transplanting of the seedlings, at the two-leaves-stage (less than 15 days after sowing). At this stage, the plant still has the potential to make a lot of tillers, and develop a strong root system. The seedlings are transplanted carefully, so the plant doesn\u2019t suffer a transplanting shock.\n- Wide spacing of single seedlings, usually in squares. The recommended spacing goes from 25 to 50 cm, depending on the soil fertility. This transplanting technique reduces the concurrence between the rice plants and allows the land user easier weeding.\n- Aerating the soil. Rice is produced in standing water, but grows better if the roots are aerated. This is usually done with weeding, and additionally either by alternately flooding and letting the soil dry out, or by draining the water regularly.  - The soil is fed with compost or manure in order to enhance the fertility and improve the soil structure.\nSRI induces changes in deeply rooted local habits with some counter-intuitive knowledge like that more seeds do not produce more yields. Thus the methods have to be adapted locally and yields monitored to fit to other areas.\nIn Kampong Chhnang, the rice is transplanted at the six-leaves-stage, which is still earlier than conventional transplanting, with spacing of about 15 to 20 cm.\nIn Kampong Chhnang, the labour availability is low, as many young people work abroad or in the garment industry. Thus the SRI principles, which were taught by an NGO in 2004, were not followed completely, but adapted to this major constraint. The use of very young seedlings requires careful transplanting, which takes time. Thus the seedlings are transplanted at the 6 leaves stage. Due to the low soil fertility in the area, the optimal spacing as tested by CARDI (Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute), was about 20 by 20 cm.\nThe rice seeds are soaked in water for 24 hours, and then let to germinate in a hot and humid place for two days. Then they are sown on the seed bed, which is prepared with compost. As there is not enough compost available for all the fields, the seedbed is the only place where compost is applied. In the fields chemical fertilizer is used. The seedlings are transplanted after 20 to 25 days (5-6 leaves) single or two per hill, in rows 15 to 20 cm apart. They are transplanted in better levelled fields than conventional transplanting, to allow the use of less water, as the seedlings are smaller than conventional. Otherwise the water management is the same as conventional; due to the lack of labour availability, the fields are not drained as proposed by the NGO 10 years ago. The field is weeded with hoes. The rice is harvested after 85 % of the panicle turned yellow, thus obtaining the best quality.\nThe analysed area is flat (slope \u003C 2%), with a tropical climate (dry season from November to May and wet season from June to October), and the soils are mostly sandy or loamy. The soil has a low fertility, contains little organic matter, and acidifies. The area has been deforested a long time ago, and the groundwater table is rather high (1-2 m during the dry season, on the surface during wet season).\nDue to climate change, farmers notice more erratic rainfalls, temperature rises and more recurrent droughts. Rice is the predominant crop grown in the area, since it serves as staple food (mix subsistence and commercial activities).\nThe increasing migration rate (the young generation leaves the villages to work in the cities, garment industry or abroad) results in a decrease of available labour force in the area which has detrimental effects on the agricultural activities. Furthermore, the civil war in the 1970s (Khmer Rouge) led to the loss of agricultural knowledge which different NGOs try to re-establish.\nCOMMENTS:\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Lack of organic matter, lack of water retention in soil, irregularity of rainfall, low soil fertility (sandy soil), monocultures, bare soil during dry season, ploughing.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Low soil fertility, sandy soil with low water retention.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"","type_id":"","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Cambodia","country_origin_od":"303","region":"Asia","region_id":"103","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"11","id":"33956","title":"Adding Soil","short_description":"To add red (fertile, nutrient rich) valley soil to degraded white soil on slopes (in olive orchards)\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Liesbeth ColenRed soil is taken from valley fields, mines and construction work, transported to the slopes and added around the stem of each tree, ca. 2 m^3 per tree.

Possibility to be combined with drainage system for better results.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Milenko Blesi\u0107Farmers in northeast parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina traditionally applied the technology to address shallow landslides, surface erosion or loss of top soil due to sheet or interrill erosion. Movements of the upper layers of the soil appears due to unfavorable properties of the soil layers (clays, pseudoclays), set on impermeable geological substrates, all under conditions of intense and long-term rainfall. During the last decades, it has been frequently applied in the area of Kladanj municipality, whose administrative services for agriculture and forestry technically specified and promoted the technology. Landslides are one of the major problems in the hilly areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, threatening particularly the agricultural lands. The technology is being applied by farmers on their own properties, but it is also part of public interventions, e.g. for the protection of roads or other infrastructure from landslides or in the context of roads recovery programs damaged by landslides. The technology aims to reduce the impact of the shallow (up to 2 - 3 m in depth) landslides of relatively small surface, by preventing further movement of the soil. So far, it is sporadically applied on around 20 \u2013 30 locations in Kladanj Municipality, whose territory is around 355 sq. kilometers.\nThe technology implies pounding wooden poles in front (below) of the frontline of the landslide, along the contour, perpendicular to the slope. Land users recommend oaken pols due to their durability. The poles are usually 3.5 \u2013 4 m long and 20 \u2013 30 cm in diameter. One pole formation consists of two parallel lines of poles, with 1.5 to 2 m distance from line to line. The poles are positioned in a staggered way that a zigzag is formed. The poles are interconnected with wooden laths. One pole formation is usually enough to address smaller landslides, but in case of larger landslides, two formations are recommended. In the latter case, in combination with a drainage system, stone counterforts are formed in front (above) the poles\u0027 formation. See technical drawing for more details.\nThe primary purpose of the technology is to recover shallow and small landslides on slopping terrains. Stopping the movement of agricultural land after reparation of cracks and land gaps caused by landfall enables re-utilization of the land for either agricultural production or agro-forestry. In the municipality of Kladanj walnuts or other wooden fruit species with strong roots are often planted on recovered landslides.\nAfter a prior assessment of the depth and surface of the landslide, an expert or a technician prepares simple project sketches. The sketches define configuration of pole formations and materials needed for the construction (oak poles, laths). The realization of the technology is not particularly demanding. Nowadays machines are used to pound poles in the ground (mainly by a dredge\u0027s spoon).\nIt is a relatively inexpensive technology which could be financed by even small farmers who can protect or recover their, under Bosnia and Herzegovina conditions, usually small agricultural land parcels.\nAlthough not an integral part of the technology, modification with water drainage from the body of bigger landslide ensures additional, long lasting stability of the terrain. If performed, the drainage is carried out by depositing drainage material (perforated pipes, pebbles, tiny stone fractions) in the lower zone of drainage trenches whose configuration and depth depends on the terrain conditions. Another modification of the technology could include construction of a stone counterfort in front (above) the pole formation. These modifications are briefly presented in the technical specification of the technology, but they were not applied on the site (Borak locality) where activities, establishment and maintenance costs of the technology were observed.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe technology could be applied on various types of land use. In the northeast region of Bosnia and Herzegovina it is commonly applied on: grazing land, cropland (annual, perennial, trees and shrubs), and mixed land uses. In Kladanj municipality the technology is frequently applied for protection or reconstruction of roads damaged by landslides.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"","type_id":"","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"1.

The main species used are Prosopis juliflora, Parkinsonia aculeata, Jatropha curcas, Atriplex spp, Acacia holosericea, Acacia victoriae, Lantana camara and others, in arid areas and Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Grevillea robusta, Pinus and Cupressus ssp. in highland and humid areas.\nPurpose of the Technology: The climatic conditions are characterized by high spatial and temporal variability of the rainfall. The rains are concentrated in two or three months (August and September or October); the highlands and the N-NE parts are wetter compared to the low lands or coastal areas, which are very dry. The average annual rainfall is about 225 mm over the whole island; it has declined since the 1960s, with negative effects on farming conditions, and water supply. However, in areas located more than 500 m above sea level and exposed to trade winds, rainfall can exceed 700 mm. About 20% of the precipitation is lost through runoff, 13% infiltrates the soil and recharges aquifers and 67% evaporates. The evaporation loss is a limiting factor for any agriculture or forestry. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt the afforestation implementation to the specific local conditions (slope, stone cover, climate, etc). To overcome and minimize the problem of water scarcity, several measures are applied: (a) caldeira or half-moon structures achieved with earth or stone; (b) contour furrows or level bench terraces with stone walls arranged along the contour; (c). small dams to protect gullies. The aim is to maximize retention of water and control surface runoff. This not only allows better infiltration of water for the tree plantations, but also protects against soil erosion and facilitates groundwater recharge.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The success of the reforestation may be indicated not only by the area covered but also by the number of introduced plants. In 1975, there were about 3,000 ha of afforested land. By 2011, there are over 90,000 ha of afforested land with almost 50 million trees. Afforestation has focused mainly on the island of Santiago and Santo Ant\u00e3o, (13% of the total area reforested). Nowadays, more than 20% of the country is afforested. The forest has had a great importance in the context of combating desertification, rehabilitation of vegetation cover, in meeting energy needs and forage production and in developing agrosilvopastoral systems, as well as having undoubtedly contributed to a significant modification of the landscape in Cape Verde. The afforestation activities also contributed to increase biodiversity of some species of birds, including \u201cGalinha di mato\u201d (Numida meleagris), \u201cCodorniz\u201d (Coturnix coturnix), \u201cPassarinha\u201d (Halcyon leucocephala) and others.\nNatural \/ human environment: The forest species are mainly used for land protection and for production of fuel wood and coal. Because of the poor growing conditions, the forest species are not well suited to the construction industry or wood processing.\nCOMMENTS:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 71.5 km2\nThe forest with the greatest density of trees occupies an area of 2.51 km2 and is located in the area of higher altitude.

Much forest cover in Mwizi has been decimated as the need for fuel wood, charcoal and land for agriculture has increased.  Coupled with changing weather patterns, human and livestock pressure, many ridges and hilly slopes have been left bare.  With annual rainfall of over 1200 mm, runoff often causes extensive damage to cropland and road infrastructure. \nIn Rubagano, the Forest Department of the Government of Uganda set aside over 20 km2 of degraded ridges and hilly slopes for tree planting.  The department planted the first part as a demonstration.  The other part is being planted by individuals.  Projects such as ULAMP (5 to 10 years ago) and Kagera TAMP (since 2011) have worked with the communities in the area, encouraging the technology by supplying Pinus spp seedlings, training farmers to start their own tree nurseries and forming Farmer Field Schools as vehicles for generation of community consensus on sustainable land management interventions.\nPurpose of the Technology: The objectives of afforestation are to provide protection of the land against soil erosion, to return productivity to degraded hilly slopes,  to reduce crop (banana) devastation caused by strong winds during rainy season, to grow the capacity of available fuel wood in the area, to diversify future households incomes and protect public infrastructure, especially the road network during the rainy season.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Most of the older trees, 3 years and over, were planted from seedlings bought from established tree growers.  Currently, the Farmer Field Schools are planting seedlings from their own nurseries.  In the nursery, plastic sleeves called poly-pots are packed with top-soil mixed with animal manure to provide a growing medium. A calculated amount of sand is added to enhance drainage.  Sowing, watering and root pruning are carried out manually.\nOut on the hilly slopes, the land user establishes the woodlot and maintains the trees using his own resources.

The first step was to establish hillside terraces on the steeper slopes where it is essential to conserve soil and water for improved growth of trees and other vegetation. The terraces comprise earthen embankments laid out along the along the contour, reinforced with stone risers, combined with a trench on the upper side to harvest runoff water. The trenches are subdivided into basins (by ties) to avoid lateral flow of runoff water. In a second step, trees were planted at a spacing of 2 m (in the trenches). Mostly fast growing eucalyptus was used, with a very small percentage of the indigenous African olive (Olea africana) - which has good survival rates but grows very slowly. Afforested areas are closed for any use until the trees reach maturity: they are protected by guards. In 1995 the Ministry of Agriculture handed over user rights to communities allowing cut-and-carry of grass and cutting of trees (with permission of the government). The technology requires appreciable expense, labor and expertise, but if maintained well, it results in multiple ecological and economic benefits: Soil cover has improved, water is conserved, the severe problems of soil erosion have been reduced, and dams further downstream are protected from siltation. Trees have become an important source of income for the rural communities, wood is a valuable resource mainly needed for construction, and also as fuel. Since the 1960s, several afforestation campaigns have been initiated by the government, mainly using food-for-work or cash-for-work approaches as incentives.

The Chokar watershed is a mountainous area situated between 600 and 2,500 m above sea level. The climate is semi-arid with harsh and cold weather in winter, and hot and dry summers. The annual precipitation in average years is 580 mm. Land degradation affects all forms of land use, and includes low levels of vegetation cover, severe water erosion of topsoil, and poor soil fertility. Unsustainable agricultural practices, over-exploitation and high pressure on the natural resources are adversely impacting the socio-economic well-being of local communities, as well as contributing to the risk of being adversely affected by drought - and landslides and flash foods triggered by heavy rainfall. The data used for the documentation of the technology are based on field research conducted in Chokar watershed, namely in the villages of Sari Joy, Jawaz Khana and Dashti Mirzai. These villages represent the upper, the middle and the lower zones of Chokar watershed, respectively. They differ considerably in access to services and infrastructure, but in general are poorly served. The communities depend on land resources for sustaining their livelihoods. In a good year with high yields, wheat self-sufficiency lasts about 5 months. The three villages are home to ethnic Qarluq communities. Since 2012 the Livelihood Improvement Project Takhar (LIPT) implemented by Terre des hommes (Tdh) Switzerland has initiated a range of NRM interventions\nDespite the low forest cover in Rustaq, Afghanistan, local communities strongly rely on fuelwood and animal dung for cooking and heating throughout the whole year. Forests are mainly found on community land with open access to all, and there are no protection measures in place. The high demand on fuelwood for household needs places strong pressure on the remaining patches of forests and bushes, which are currently threatened by eradication. Such high demand in the area is likely to remain as there are no other alternative energy sources. The mass destruction of local forests is one of the main causes of intensive erosion, aridification, loss of topsoil and formation of gullies. Low forest cover increases vulnerability to severe rainfall and risks of landslides.  \nAfforestation measures in the three villages were initiated to halt the land degradation and provide sustainable firewood. The reforestation sites are largely on community land with a small share on private land.  The area is characterized by hilly (16-30%) and steep (31-60%) slopes. Planting and maintaining forest in such conditions requires close support in the appropriate design of forest plots, and relevant maintenance recommendations, which can then ensure the survival of the plantation. A plot of 0.2 ha is divided into 4 m x 3 m sections. Each tree is placed in a pit of 50 cm x 30 cm with rich soil around the roots. Once the tree is planted, it is watered and covered with lime. Russian willow, acacia, mulberry and almond are the most common tree species used for afforestation purposes.  \nMost of the newly established forest sites are located at walking distance of the nearby villages: this is important to help provide protection of the plot from animal intrusion and ensure proper maintenance of the trees. The forest plot is watered for three years in a row. The Natural Resources Management Committees (NRMC) pays 0.60 US cents per tree per year to sustain the survival of the plantation within the first year.  The funding for the irrigation is provided by the Livelihood Improvement Project Takhar (LIPT). LIPT supported the afforestation activities through the provision of technical and financial support. The tree seedlings were supplied by the project, and financial incentives were provided to engage the community in tree-planting. \nThe plantations are still very young: however, the land users express support for the new forest in their villages, and have observed localized stabilization of the soil and improvement in vegetation cover. There are high expectations of the new forest, which promises access to sustainable fuelwood and non-forest products, such as almonds and mulberry. The grass and tree leaves from the forest plots are already used for animal fodder.\nWomen and children under 15 years old are expected to be the direct beneficiaries of the new forest. They will no longer spend long hours to collect and deliver fuelwood, bushes and dung. A small portion of women reported involvement in forest establishment activities, while the majority are taking part in protecting the forests from livestock.\nCOMMENTS:\nThis documentation is based on the experiences of SLM impementers from Sari Joy (5  plots), Jawaz Khana, (4  plots), and Dashti Mirzai (3 plots) as compiled during focus group discussions. Additionally insights were gained through interviews in all three villages on farmers experiences and observations of afforestation plots, with both  SLM implementers (20) and observers (10).\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"1.

Planting multi-purpose tree species in such lands can facilitate soil fertility restoration and the re-initiation of agricultural production. Abandoned land starts producing financial benefits by providing the population with wood for fuel and construction, medicines, edible fruits, foliar forage and other products. The effective selection of tree species can improve ecological services such as the reduction of water logging through transpiration (biodrainage); reduction of soil salinity, increase of soil nitrogen availability through nitrogen fixing and organic matter from leaf litter. In the long run, the plots of land may again be returned into the category of arable land (rotational agroforestry) or continue being used for forest plantations (in the frame of CACILM).\nPurpose of the Technology: To increase the productivity of agricultural lands,  rehabilitate agroecosystems and improve rural livelihoods through introduction of tree plantations on agricultural land\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The most important component for the creation of tree plantations in marginal land is the selection of multi-purpose tree species with a variety of criteria, the main ones being salinity and drought tolerance as well as high biodrainage and nitrogen fixing capacity. Recommendations for Khorezm include three species, namely: oleaster (Elaeagnus angustifolia) a nitrogen fixing species, Turanga poplar (Populus euphratica) a fast-growing species, and Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila) a resilient species. Land preparation includes plot leveling, plowing and the leaching of salt. Seedlings of different species are planted according to a 1\u04451.75 m layout of unmixed rows, with species alternating every 5-7 rows. Dense planting allows for the harvesting of biomass by thinning the first years\u2019 growth (for fuel and foliar forage). Gradually, the width between each row increases up to 3-5 meters. In the future, biomass is harvested through the sustainable trimming of tree limbs. During the first 2 years, a reduced irrigation rate is applied (10-30% less). After that, no irrigation is applied and trees are sustained by groundwater\nNatural \/ human environment: The technology is adapted to the conditions of Khorezm oblast, Uzbekistan, an ancient irrigated oasis in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya River. The area features an extremely flat terrain with poor drainage of groundwater. Due to natural conditions and improper use of water and land resources, the land is affected by high salinity and water logging. The main occupation of the local population is the cultivation of cotton, winter wheat, vegetables, gourds and melons. Farmers, the main landowners, own the land on the basis of long-term rent.

Trees hold the soil and reduce runoff, and thus prevent erosion of the most fertile layers. It is an effective way to rehabilitate degraded lands, being a nature-based solution which addresses floods and soil erosion. As vegetation cover plays a crucial role in erosion and runoff rates, afforestation is considered among the best options for soil conservation. Water-related forest ecosystem services include the provision, filtration and regulation of water, along with stream ecosystem support and water-related hazard control, for example soil protection from runoff and erosion. In this context, forest management practices that involve vegetation cover modifications may have a substantial impact on the provision of water-related ecosystem services. Moreover, forest ecosystem interactions with water and energy cycles have been highlighted as the foundations for carbon storage, water resources distribution and terrestrial temperature balancing. Forest management may thus play a key role in meeting climate change mitigation goals as well (Rodrigues et al. 2020).\nAfforestation is recommended in areas affected by severe erosion, especially where the slope exceeds 17% and deep gully erosion occurs. This can be a whole parcel or only a part of it. Planting mixed forest consisting of indigenous tree species is the most advantageous. \nThe main steps in planting\/ maintaining trees are as follows:\n\u2022Site preparation: considerations include the most effective and cost-efficient methods; soil type, existing vegetation, time and financial constraints.\n\u2022Planting: machine-planting or hand-planting.\n\u2022Follow-up: monitoring survival, continuing control of competing vegetation, providing protection from animal damage, and monitoring for disease and insects.\n\u2022Harvesting\/thinning: removing individual trees to reduce the woodland density. Through removing poorer quality trees, the stronger thrive.\nAlthough the long-term environmental benefits of afforestation are significant, farmers generally do not like participating in afforestation programmes because it means a significant loss of income in the short\/mid-term (even with the available subsidies\/agricultural support).\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"1.

The southern part of the country,Herzegovina, is ecologically very vulnerable and characterized by the dominance of limestone-dolomite rocks, with shallow and poorly developed soils, water deficiency over vegetation period and poor water regime, which is an additional aggravating factor for successful afforestation. Under such conditions, afforestation is the most widely used SLM measure in the area, which is characterized by karst landscapes. Namely, since 1950, there was a combination of vegetation and technical measures that would increase the chances of success when reforesting Herzegovina\u0027s bare land.\nBare land is a result of the natural features of the given region, but very often is exacerbated by unsustainable forest management, and frequent fires that have an impact on vegetation cover. This creates preconditions for soil erosion and contamination of drinking water springs. Afforestation of bare land is applied throughout the territory of Herzegovina, but mainly on forestland and public owned areas. The specificity of the natural conditions of the Herzegovinian karst, greatly reduces the range of plant species that could be considered suitable for afforestation. Also, limestone-dolomite soils are usually shallow, dry and xero-termophilic and require irrigation to increase success. However, irrigation is still not being applied on forestland, therefore forest managers use other possible measures that could reduce the water deficit in the first years of plant life, including afforestation\nThe Karst Management Center (under the jurisdiction of the Public Forest Enterprize \u201c\u0160ume Republike Srpske\u201d and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management), is located in Trebinje, and manages the forests and forest land of six municipalities in Herzegovina . Every year, as part of the regular forest\/karst management measures, bare land is afforested, using plant species produced in forest nurseries of the Republika Srpska. The most used ones are Pinus nigra, Pinus halepensis and Cupressus sempervirens. The newly established forest nursery in Trebinje, is consisted of ecologically adapted species to Mediterranean conditions, which constitutes a step forward to increase success of afforestation. Plants are produced in containers whose root system is coated with high quality substrate and protected by plastic foil.\nThe basic characteristic of the SLM measure \u201cafforestation on bare land\u201d is the deeper holes that need to be dug in comparison to a \u201cregular\u201d afforestation. The dimensions of the holes are 50x50x50cm. Due to the unfavourable conditions (high level of rockiness, shallow soils, steep slopes, water deficit etc.), it is possible to plant maximum up to 1400 plants per hectare. A low-height stonewall is being built around the hole of the tree at the lower part of the mountain, so it can retain the water from the upper parts, reduce degradation and retain soil moisture.This is particularly important for steeper slopes where it is essential to conserve soil and water for improved growth of trees and other vegetation. After putting the seedlings into the holes, soil is being put around the root system, and polyvinyl foil is being placed in funnel form, to collect rainwater and create a compact compound of the substrate in the touching zone with the soil around the root.\nThe best period for afforestation in Herzegovina is October and November. The technology requires manual work due to level of rockiness and steep slopes, which does not allow any use of machines. Planting seedlings  is favorable during autumn due to soil compression after the rainfall of September when the contact between the holes and the substratum is fully established. This is especially important for plant resistance against drought, which lead to physiological weakness. Planting seedlings at the beginning of March is favorable only in cases when no drought occurs immediately after planting. This is possible only in the more continental part of the Karst area. When planting a tree, it is important to bear in mind that wind erosion can occur. Therefore, the substrate should be placed below the surface of the soil in the holes, especially if the planting is carried out immediately after the first rainfall followed by a warm summer period. This is a traditional technique of karst and bare land management, but new species better adapted to the landscape have been recently introduced.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","country_origin_od":"292","region":"Europe","region_id":"104","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"Academia and researchers, Farmers\u0026#039; associations, Agriculture cooperatives, Rural communities, Indigenous communities, Large size farms \/ farmers, Medium size farms \/ farmers, Smallholder farms \/ farmers, Farm advisors, Large enterprises, Small-medium enterprises, Small-micro entrepreneurs, Civil society organizations, Food consumers, Central government entities, Local government entities, International organizations, Funders and investors, Consortium of partners","prospective_users_id":"1, 2, 3, 4, 2074, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 2075, 17","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"Public Forest Enterprize \u0026amp;quot;\u0160ume Republike Srpske\u0026amp;quot;, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management (Bosnia and Herzegovina)","partner_text":"Public Forest Enterprize \u0026amp;quot;\u0160ume Republike Srpske\u0026amp;quot;, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management (Bosnia and Herzegovina)","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"21","id":"33966","title":"Afforestation with mangrove plants to protect land degradation","short_description":"Mangrove afforestation in newly accreted land along cooastal regions accelerates the process of land stabilization, creates new forest resources, and enriches biodiversity.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Fazlay ArafatMaheshkhali is the only hilly island of Bangladesh and situated in northwest of Cox\u2019s Bazar. This island has become a tourist destination for its mangrove plantation and ancient Adinath Temple situated at the hilltop. Historically the island had suffered from coastal erosion and structural measures like building blocks along the coast were implemented in some places to protect the Adinath hill from erosion. The Maheshkhali channel have deposited sediments in the near-shore zone and formed mud banks along the coast. This newly accreted land and other lands were used for mangrove plantations, which stabilized the land and provided protection against coastal erosion, storm damage, flooding, and siltation of adjacent seagrass beds. Mangrove plantations can provide a long-term and cost-effective solution to coastal erosion while at the same time improving the landscape aesthetically and increasing ecological habitats. Before the mangroves were planted, the existing shrub and tree vegetation along the coastline of Maheshkhali was scattered. The barren and exposed coastline is now converted to a green shelter-belt and protecting the soil. Bangladesh Forest Department is the land user and the mangrove plantation was carried out with the support from World Bank through \u0022Forest Resource Management Plan (FRMP)\u0022 project in 1997. Later, some new plantation also carried out in 2016 on newly accreted land through \u0022Climate Resilient Participatory Afforestation and Reforestation Project (CRPARP).\nThe mangrove plant species Baen (Avicennia officinalis) was used to create the plantation. Salinity in coastal regions increased as consequence of global warming and Avicennia officinalis is among the most salt tolerant species that prefer clay soil. The young tree forms a low, dense bushy crown. When it matures, it forms a columnar tree up to 15 m and may grow up to 30 m. The spreading root system of the plant also provides stability in shifting substrates. When planting mangroves, site selection and proper nursery management is crucial. Geo-morphological changes in coastal areas can be rapid and unpredictable, making it difficult to identify suitable sites correctly. Accreted land with grasses and crab burrows indicating a stable site, ideal for planting. The experience of field staff is a key factor in identifying suitable sites.  Nursery management is carried out by forest department. Seed collection, site clearing, leveling and fencing, drainage arrangement, bed preparation, making overhead shed, poly-bag preparation, potting seeds, manuring, irrigation and weed control are the major activities of nursery management. Proper care of seedlings needs to be ensured while transporting from nursery to plantation site thorough boat. Gunny bags can be used to carry the seedlings while transporting. The spacing between each plant was 1.5m x 1.5m and 4444 seedlings\/ha were planted in the visited site. Compost fertilizer was used both in nursery and while planting in pit. After planting, each seedling was tied up with a bamboo stick for support and to prevent from washing away in tides. The plantation activities were carried out by the staff of forest department.  As mangrove afforestation is carried out in unstable environments, there is always a risk of losing some plantation during the time it takes for trees to reach maturity.\nCoastal afforestation accelerates the process of land stabilization, and by creating new forest land it enriches biodiversity and natural resources. It also protects the lives and property of the coastal population against cyclones and tidal surges. The plantation develops suitable habitats for wildlife, fish and other estuarine and marine fauna. It produces timber for fuelwood and industrial uses. However, the local community people can only collect fuelwood and other non-timber forest products like honey, crabs and fishes from this plantation site. The mangrove plantation increased the aesthetic beauty of the area and also create employment opportunities for remote rural communities through eco-tourism.\nCOMMENTS:\nDue to the establishment of mangrove plantation, the degraded land is now covered with vegetation and protected from land degradation\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"1.

Furthermore, this region was already abandoned (rural exodus) and missing management practices increased the problem of erosion. Therefore the government mandated to afforest the burnt areas in 1985.\nThe main purpose of the afforestation was to reduce the soil erosion (which was severe at that time) by planting trees, which increases soil stability and enables forest growth again. But the state also wanted to ensure wood extraction in the future. Furthermore, the visual impact was an important driver for afforesting this area.\nThe afforestation was executed in the winter of 1985 (November-February\/March) by the regional forest services (Conselleria de agricultura). Forest engineers, who worked for the state and planned the project, collaborated with forest agents whereas the involved forest agents contracted local villagers to help afforesting these areas. The forest agent acted as a link between engineer and forest brigade and controlled if the brigade executed what the engineer proposed. He also provided assistance to the workers. The forest brigade was paid by day-if it was raining, people did not work and did not get any salary.\nNobody could provide direct information on the afforestation process in 1985 but there are not many differences of how they did it in the past and how it works today. The planting holes (60cm x 60cm x 60cm) were created with a machine (Caterpillar) using a \u201cspoon\u201d to open a hole and cover it again. This process loosens the soil (only possible in soils which are free from big stones). It should be noted that they did not use a ripper, they knew that the soil is destroyed using this technique. The seedlings were planted manually by the forest workers and arranged linearly because this facilitated the handling of the machines. Since the soil had a low stone content, it was suitable for the establishment of a forest.\nThe afforested area covered around 100 ha (not continuously). Today, the costs of an afforestation are around 1500 Euro per ha, but in the past it was less expensive. They only planted Pinus Halepensis. Today, a seedling of this tree species costs between 20 and 60 Cents. If the regional forest services have their own nurseries, they do not need to spend money to buy seedlings.\nThe success of an afforestation depends on numerous factors such as aspect and humidity (better on north-facing slopes), soil amount\/fertility (better conditions on former cultivated fields), origin of the seedlings (adapted to the local climatic conditions), variability\/uncertainty of the weather conditions (e.g. droughts, freezing). Usually a plantation is done in October\/November and therefore especially the first summer determines the success. If it is too dry the plant will not grow (roots are too short to reach the humidity deeper in the ground). Further, the availability of trained people and the selection of appropriate machines are crucial.\nThe documented afforestation is one of a few examples of afforestation trials which succeeded. Today there is a forest where young pines are growing naturally (\u0022children\u0022 of the planted ones), but also resprouter species (e.g. Quercus) can be found, which regenerated without having been planted and apparently were dispersed by birds.\nBut there are also some problems related to this afforestation. The forest agent explained that there is a high pest risk since monoplantations are less resilient to diseases (sick or dead plants in turn increase the fire risk). Another problem is that the trees were planted too densely (800-1000 plants per ha with a spacing of 5-10m) which requires recurrent management of the forest. Knowing about this problem, around the year 2003 they managed the area doing a selective clearing to reduce both the continuity and the competition between the species and thus also reduced the fire risk (\u201cayuda regeneraci\u00f3n\u201d). But the forest has become extremely dense again, thus increasing the risk of fires. There is a need to manage this area again and to extract biomass (selective clearing), but unfortunately no management project is planned for the near future.\nThe region of Ayora is mountainous with a dry subhumid climate (~380 mm annual rainfall). The risk of fire incidence is at its highest from June to September when there are adverse conditions like drought, high temperatures and strong winds (mainly the winds coming from central Spain, called \u201cponiente\u201d).\nThe population density is very low and there are only few job opportunities (e.g. marginal agriculture, grazing, hunting, beekeeping). The plantation provided jobs for rural people. Also today forest management could be a source for jobs.\nCOMMENTS:\nBoundary points of the Technology area: In the kmz file the whole afforestation of 1985\/1986 is shown but it is not clear whether the whole area was afforested successfully. The coordinates indicated above show the location I visited which had success.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The past land use resulted in a change of the vegetation composition (e.g. through removal of resprouter species). Due to rural exodus and land abandonment, the natural succession took place and fire-prone early-successional species colonized the abandoned fields. The vegetation grew without any control which seems to have caused the devastating fire of the year 1979 which destroyed 33\u2019000 ha of forest. As a consequence of this fire, strong erosion processes occurred on the bare soil and hindered the vegetation to regrow. Furthermore, people which still lived there lost their properties after the fire and moved away as well. A consequence of the depopulation was a lack of management practices which increased the problem of post-fire erosion.\nNumber of growing seasons per year:\n    1\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"1.

This case study focuses on the \u201cCluster System\u201d which is suitable for an organized group of independent vegetable producers sharing a common water delivery system. From a central source, water is distributed through a pipe network to a cluster of plots. Each farmer operates a 1,000 m2 unit, and each is equipped with an elevated 200 litre barrel and a standard irrigation kit, including a tap, filter and thick-tube drip laterals. Minimal size of an AMG unit should be 500 m2. Affordable high-quality material is used and the design and operation is simple. The barrel also serves as a fertilizer tank.  A float ensures a constant pressure head. Water supply is calculated by the time needed for delivery of the daily water dosage, or through the use of water dosing valves. Producers have individual control of water use. Since the AMG requires only 1 meter pressure for operation, it can draw on low-capacity renewable energy sources such as elevated dams, solar pumps or reservoirs. To supply an area of 50,000 m2 with 8 mm\/day in the hot season a 400 m3-reservoir is required. The crops are planted on elevated beds. Water mixed with urea as fertilizer is applied daily. Drip irrigation improves growing conditions for crops while at the same time saving labor, water and other inputs. AMG is promoted as a holistic management package, integrating all aspects of production, post-harvest and marketing in one system. This includes the use of improved vegetable varieties, improved crop husbandry, integrated pest management, as well as improved storage, processing and marketing of products, and improved access to inputs.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The following establishment activities are connected to this technology: 1. Build concrete reservoir. 2. Drill borehole (110 mm diameter; 12 m deep, hand drilled). 3. Install motor pump and tubes to connect well with reservoir. 4.

These structures characterise a large part of the landscape in Cyprus, and especially in communities around Troodos Mountains where large areas have been converted to agricultural terraces. The typical terraces found in the study-area are narrow (1-3 m) to medium-base (3-6 m) bench terraces, constructed by cutting and filling in slopes between 20-40%. The terraces are supported by walls, whereby stone is the only construction material without any binding mortar.\nTerracing is one of the oldest means of cultivating slopes while saving soil and water. Due to the steep terrain of Troodos Mountains, the establishment of terraces acts as sediment trap storing the washed-off soil material within the slope. In general, terraces were created to stop or reduce the degrading effect of soil erosion by intercepting and controlling the surface run-off velocity and by facilitating its slower infiltration. In such a way, the sediment that accumulates behind the terraces has created suitable land for farming. In addition, the construction of dry-stone walls serves a dual purpose: to clear the land from large rock and stones, and to enhance the stability of the bench terraces against loss of top-soil. This is a type of technology that was very much used in the past and seen today as an important cultural landscape and heritage for these communities.\nThe construction of dry-stone walls was usually completed by the family who owned the field. Men undertook the building while the rest of the family carried the stones; assistance was also offered by relatives and friends of the family. First, the topography, the height and shape of the terrace is evaluated. Using a fuse, the craftsman shapes a straight line which would follow while building the wall. The foundations are created by excavating a pit of ~0.3-0.5 m, depending on the type of soils and the size of the wall; fuse, pick, mattock and shovel are the typical tools used. The pit is filled with large, irregular-shaped stones.\nThe stones are used in their natural shape for the construction of the walls without any processing. They are separated according to their shape, size and texture. The stones usually come from the cleaning of fields which will be cultivated or from a small-scale quarrying of the mountain slope using pick and lever. Large and irregular stones are used for the foundations, and the more regular ones for the construction of walls. The smaller stones are placed in between the large stones as the linchpin, to provide better stability to the structure.\nThe wall follows the land inclination and is laid over the foundation. Large stones are placed on the lower courses of the wall and on the exterior side. The stones are placed by hand one over the other, while smaller stones and rubbles are put between them in order to achieve more stability and better positioning; the stones cross both vertically and horizontally in order to avoid the creation of columns which will make the structure less stable. The wall is built lengthwise following the foundations and it reclines inwards; declination from the foundations does not exceed 5%. The back side of the wall is filled-up with more irregular stones which are not suitable to be placed on the front side. The filling connects the wall with the soil and stabilises the structure, and allows the drainage of water that is collected from the terrace and is discharged through the stones of the wall.\nTerrace farming of grapes, nut and fruit trees, along with natural (mainly sclerophylous) vegetation constitute the predominant land uses in this area. The total population in the eight mountain communities of Peristerona Watershed has decreased by more than 50% over the past 30 years. The depopulation of mountain communities is associated with the urbanisation trends and the high farming costs which led to the gradual reduction of agricultural activities in the area. These socio-economic attributes form the main constraining factors for soil conservation. Thus, although terraces have a particularly beneficial effect in maintaining the productive capacity of soils in these communities, the significant changes in the socio-economic structure of the agricultural population over the last decades and the high maintenance and labour required, has led farmers to gradually abandon terrace farming. Consequently, many of the mountain terraces are no longer cultivated and dry stone walls are not maintained, causing sometimes a domino effect of collapsing terraces.\nCOMMENTS:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 30.9 km2.\nDry-stone terraces characterise a large part of the landscape in Cyprus, and especially in communities around Troodos Mountains. There is a large variety of dry-stone terraces on the island, according to the morphology of each area and the accessibility to raw materials. The information reported here refer to the mountain communities in Northeast Pitsilia and particularly to the Peristerona watershed upstream communities (RECARE project case-study site).Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soil erosion by water from degraded and collapsing dry-stone terraces.\nLoss of productive capacity.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Gradual collapse of dry-stone walls.\nRoot rot and yield failure as a result of water-logging which is linked to poor drainage in terraced fields.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"1.

The technology increases and diversifies production, generating social, economic and environmental benefits. In addition, planted around houses, trees offer hurricane protection.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Joana EichenbergerAgroforestry systems in Haiti are traditional land use practices characterised by a multi-storey arrangement of tall native trees, fruit species at various heights and a range of perennial and annual crops below. In L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, large agroforestry systems are reduced to areas on less sun-exposed and more humid north-facing slopes.  They are often agro-silvo-pastoralist systems, since while land users take their animals into small forests for grazing, their cattle also feed on old banana stems. In return, animal manure fertilizes the soil. In order to implement this technology, land users plant fruit trees and cash crops in the understorey of conserved, mature trees, e.g. Samanea saman, a popular tree for agroforestry, as its characteristic umbrella shape protects the crops underneath from sun damage. The most common crops used for agroforestry in L\u00e9og\u00e2ne are yam, mango, breadfruit, banana, pomelo and papaya. This system also provides an excellent environment for the cash crops of coffee and cacao. There is no particular layout in which agroforestry systems are established, but the trees and crops are equally distributed. For maintenance, land users remove weeds that compete with the crops, replace old trees\/ crops with new ones (e.g. coffee bushed are replaced every 20 years) and distribute the banana suckers (lateral shoot that emerges from the soil usually near the parent plant).\nAgroforestry systems combine economy with ecology. They enable the cultivation of edible products while at the same time conserving natural resources. In contrast to weeded\/ ploughed crops (predominately found on sunnier and drier south-facing slopes), agroforestry mitigates soil erosion when applied on slopes. The vegetation cover hinders soil compaction and improves rainwater infiltration. Therefore, agroforestry reduces runoff, replenishes groundwater and improves the quantity and quality of springs. Moreover, agroforestry protects villages and cropland downstream from floods, landslides and siltation. Land users appreciate this technology for its great diversity of products, year-round harvest and the income of cash crops. However, land users are often troubled by the time required before receiving benefits from the first harvest from the trees. This is often the hindering factor for out-scaling this technology.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Farm management|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|forestry management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 1186, 910, 1180, 912, 914, 916, 917, 918, 919, 921, 922, 927","readiness_level":"9.

In between, shrubs such as local cassava and root species already existed. The spacing followed recommendations from ICCRI (Indonesian Coffee and Cacao Research Institute) whereby 2-3 meters distance are placed in between coffee trees, with much further distances for the shade trees.

The agro-climatic zone is classified as semi-arid with mean annual precipitation of 300-400 mm. The main land use type in the area is extensive pastoralism followed by rainfed agriculture. Pastoralism is primarily practiced by transhumant Fula (Peulh) herders and further by Mauritanian Moor herders with herds of dromedaries. Vegetation cover in the area has largely been degraded due to cutting for domestic uses and cattle feeding, bushfires and overgrazing. The soil is exposed to wind erosion which carries away nutrients in the topsoil and therefore declines soil fertility. During intense rains in the rainy season, surface runoff is accelerated and leads to the formation of gullies and ravines. Quality of water sources has declined as they are being used by the local population for the purposes of body hygiene and laundry. Another factor of degradation are the oversized herds of dromedaries which consume large quantities of biomass, contribute to soil compaction due to the shape of their hooves and whose urine is perceived as noxious to the development of herb cover.

One part of the garden is cultivated with cassava, planted in the rainy season and harvested all year round. Main tree species are Prosopis juliflora, Citrus sp. and Eucalyptus camaldulensis. A hedge of mainly dead wood, alive Euphorbia balsamifera shrubs and few Eucalyptus camaldulensis trees is protecting the homegarden from roaming animals. It has the positive off-site effect of preventing the temporary pond beneath the plot from being filled up with sediments, as a consequence of wind erosion. Organic manure obtained from cattle faeces is used as a natural fertilizer.\nPurpose of the Technology: The garden was established and is managed by a single land user and his family. Main objectives are to provide food security for his family, to make a wide range of fruits and vegetables available in a zone far from the next market and to improve income through diversification. As the plot is situated on a slope (7 %) and prone to water erosion during heavy rains, a further objective is to prevent the formation of gullies and ravines through better soil stabilization.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Trees planted in this plot were chosen upon seed or seedling availability in other peoples land as the land user planted whatever he could obtain. He constructed a fence of dead wood with the aim to turn it into a life fence of Eucalyptus camaldulensis trees later. A small retention basin was built to assure the storage of water tapped from the village borehole. However, because of breakdowns of the pump and the generally low outflow of the borehole, lack of water caused high mortality in the tree nursery of Eucalyptus camaldulensis seedlings. The fence therefore remains a mainly dead fence and is very weak in certain places. The main cost of the technology is the access to the borehole which costs the landuser 20\u0027000 CFA (US-Dollar 45) per month. For the purchase of seeds for horticulture about 15\u0027000 CFA (US-Dollar 33.50) are spent per year. The use of organic manure does not involve any costs as cattle is abundant in the area.\nNatural \/ human environment: This SLM technology site is located in the sylvopastoral region of the Ferlo in the north of S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. The agro-climatic zone is classified as semi-arid with mean annual precipitation of 300-400 mm. The main land use type in the area is extensive pastoralism followed by rainfed agriculture. Pastoralism is primarily practiced by transhumant Fula (Peulh) herders and further by Mauritanian Moor herders with herds of dromedaries. Vegetation cover in the area has largely been degraded due to cutting for domestic uses and cattle feeding, bushfires and overgrazing. The soil is exposed to wind erosion which carries away nutrients in the topsoil and therefore declines soil fertility. During intense rains in the rainy season, surface runoff is accelerated and leads to the formation of gullies and ravines.\nCOMMENTS:\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): degradation of vegetation cover, wind erosion, increased surface runoff, formation of gullies and ravines, management of natural water sources (people using temporary ponds for laundry and body hygiene and at the same time as sources of drinking water)\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): surface runoff, formation of gullies and ravines, decrease of soil fertility, wind erosion, limited water access, presence of insect pests\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|field management|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 921, 918, 917, 914, 920","readiness_level":"7.

In the region of L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, agroforestry systems for subsistence are often found around houses as homegardens. In order to implement this technology, land users establish fruit trees (e.g. papaya, mango, pomelo, avocado, bread fruit, banana etc.) around their houses and then plant crops (e.g. yam) in the understorey of those trees.\nThey can also profit from conserved, mature trees, e.g. Samanea saman, a popular tree for agroforestry, as its characteristic umbrella shape protects the crops underneath from sun damage. Some of these homegardens are agro-silvo-pastoralist systems, since they include livestock production (e.g. poultry). The advantage of such systems is that the manure from livestock fertilizes the soil. There is no particular formation in which agroforestry systems are established, but the trees and crops are equally distributed. For maintenance, land users pull out weeds that compete with the crops, and replant annual crops after harvest.\nAgroforestry-based homegardens provide a great diversity of products and offer a year-round harvest. Additionally, the trees promote a favourable micro-climate, which makes this technology resilient to dry periods. Besides food security, homegardens also have a positive impact on the environment.  The vegetation cover reduces surface runoff and soil erosion. Moreover, the trees buffer wind gusts, hence they protect homes during tropical storms. The only limitation that can be attributed to this technology is that land users sometimes are troubled by the time required before receiving benefits from the first harvest from the trees.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|Farm management|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 1186, 916, 917, 918, 921, 910, 1180","readiness_level":"9.

To increase and fasten the grass growth, manure is applied twice a year, before the rainy season (around February and September), while mulching is practiced under Banana trees every season. Minimum tillage is applied to reduce soil disturbance and to increase water use efficiency by minimizing direct evaporation, increasing infiltration and water recharge (Liniger, 1991) especially during dry seasons, which results in better crop yields.\nFor timber production Grevillea trees are planted scattered overall the land and on the edge of the river for demarcation (environmental role in stabilizing the soil against erosive forces).\nConcerning the structural measures, the farmer constructed has built 14 bench terraces, six of them were designed to plant cash crops (coffee); each terrace is characterized by a ditch to cut off the drainage and collect water and nutrients; they are also used as paths to facilitate transportation and farm operations. Ditches are both drainage and infiltration types and are excavated along the contour.\nPurpose of the Technology: Beans and maize are cultivated for home consumption but partially (about 20%-4 bags of maize and half bag of beans) also for commercial purposes. Coffee is harvested twice a year, with a production of about 500 kg per season; the coffee is sold at 45 Kenyan Shillings (KSh) per kg (SL-28-arabica varieties). Indeed, the farmer is interested in cultivating the certified and improved variety called Ruiru 11 which is generally disease resistant, easy to maintain (less expensive) with a modest risk of pests (according to the farmer). Grevillea timber is sold  twice a year, only trees of 1.5 feet in diameter (about 45 cm), at about 80 KSh per feet. Beside the commercial role of Grevillea, when sufficiently grown these trees lead to a reduction of the wind speed, protect the intercrops and provide mulching material to be used over banana trees. The deep roots of mature Grevillea are not in competition with the crops for soil and water, instead they enhance infiltration (Otengi, 2007). Makadamia will be used to produce cooking oil, while bananas, avocados and mangoes are fruits collected for the local markets. Napier grass is cultivated to stabilize the ditches and for fodder production.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: There is a high initial input (mainly labour) needed to create ditches and terraces and for planting crops is required. The vegetative and structural measures require a labour intensive management during the year, for example maintenance is necessary after each rainy season to repair ditches and to rebuild terraces (e.g. because of the accumulation of soil and organic matter in the pits and ditches). Concerning Napier grass, labour is employed regularly for weed control, to cut grass for fodder and every three seasons to replace and replant the grass because it becomes less productive. Concerning trees, in the Agroforestry systems, canopies of Mango and Avocado trees shade the soil reducing evapotranspiration and therefore improving soil water storage. On the other hand, regular pruning is needed when the shadow effect obstructs photosynthesis and therefore growth of the crops planted below (maize and beans). Pruning of branches is carried out also for firewood. Furthermore, a common practice is Grevillea root pruning to conserve soil moisture (Otengi, 2007) and to reduce competition for nutrients during the growing season. Indeed, the farmer explained how superficial roots may interfere with the Banana root system and to cut them he has created small trenches. Harvesting is carried out twice during the year for both cereals and coffee.\nNatural \/ human environment: The area is characterized by rolling to hilly slopes, therefore it is exposed to erosion and land degradation. The combination of trees with mixed crops is adopted to maximise productivity and at the same time to prevent degradation by increasing the vegetative cover.\nCOMMENTS:\nAbout 1.21 ha (3 acres).\nThe area accounts for the land owned and cultivated by the farmer.

Furthermore, soil has been considered \u0027not good\u0027, because does not hold enough water due to the slope of the land. \nLivestock density: \u003C 1 LU\/km2\nFodder for 2 cows, from Napier grass\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|Farm management|field management|improved plant varieties|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|income increase|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 910, 914, 902, 916, 927, 1180, 917, 921, 920, 918","readiness_level":"7.

In total there are four trees strips (two each of willow and hazelnut), each strip of 5 metres x 240 metres and separated by 42 metres. The land between tree strips is used for annual cropping. The willow trees were planted to produce biomass for bedding in a goat pen, and the hazelnuts were planted for the production of hazelnuts. The willows, especially, will attract many natural enemies to control insect pests of the crops. All trees were bought from a local grower. A planting machine was used to plant the cuttings (3600 pieces) of willow. The hazelnut seedlings (192 pieces) were planted by hand. Weed control between the rows of hazelnut trees will be done by a motorised two-wheel cultivator. Furthermore, a picking machine in front of a small tractor will be used to collect the hazelnuts.

Rainfed arable land in Uzbekistan occupies about 743 thousand ha, located in the foothill zone on the adyrs (foothills). The slopes of rainfed land are subject to water erosion, and hence, implementation of special techniques and specific measures to grow crops is needed to preserve the upper fertile soil layer and conserve soil moisture. The technology of agroforestry reclamation of rainfed arable land consists of creation of drought-resistant tree species plantations on small terraces. Implementation of the technology includes the following activities:\n1. Traditional land preparation \u2013 plowing, harrowing, leveling and compaction of upper soil layer,\n2. Manually preparing small, 1 m wide terraces at a distance of 5 m to each other, with a sloping opposite to the general slope,\n3. Fencing an isolated agroforestry plot with a metal fence or other means to prevent damaging by livestock,\n4. Planting seedlings during spring (in March), in 5 x 5 m plots,\n5. Further activities include caring for the plantings:\n- simple drip irrigation using polyethylene bottles (during the first 2-3 years),\n- application of fertilizers (manure, compost),\n- implementation of measures to combat pests and diseases. In early spring (before the buds appear), trees are treated against pests with copper sulfate at the rate of 100-150 grams per 10 liters of water. In March, tree trunks are whitewashed with lime. The row spacings are treated with 57% fufanon at 0.6-1.0 l\/ha, or 30% benzophosphate at a rate of 2.0-2.3 kg\/ha.\nThe cost of implementing the technology is quite high - about 1200 US dollars, which acts as a deterrent factor to its widespread use. The main costs relate to the initial period - making terraces, purchasing and planting seedlings. Later, the costs are reduced - there is no need for irrigation, and weed infestation is reduced as a result of competition with matured trees.\nA feature of rainfed land conditions in the territory of technology implementation is the low precipitation. Climate and weather determine the low and unstable yield of winter wheat, crop that is traditionally grown on dryland areas. To increase the productivity of dryland farming, areas under drought-resistant crops, such as safflower, are currently expanded. Finding alternative solutions and supporting local communities whose main occupation is rainfed agriculture and livestock breeding is of paramount importance to improving living standards and well-being.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 921, 918, 917, 920, 922, 926","readiness_level":"7.

Historically, agroforestry has been used as a land management system that allowed the integration and diversification of productivity while maintaining the ecosystem biodiversity and diversifying farm landscape. Over the last fifty years the number of trees in agroecosystems in Italy was reduced of 75% due to the advent of intensive cropping systems and mechanisation, with significant changes to agriculture and landscape. In recent years, re-introduction of silvo-arable systems in the Veneto region have been supported as an agri-environmental measure of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) to improve sustainable land management.\nPurpose of the Technology: Tree and crop production in the same area are compatible and combine environmental and economic benefits. As a result, ASs have been proposed to the farmers with the aim of reducing environmental impacts and energy inputs as well as improving biodiversity and agricultural landscape.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Agroforestry systems are adjusted to the needs of modern and sustainable agriculture and farmers who adopt this technology take advantage of higher ecosystem biodiversity, incomes and labour diversification, lower energy inputs and reinforcement of natural pest control. The systems are managed with low tree intensity (50-100 trees\/ha) and large planting systems (up to 14 m in the row and 40 m inter-row) in order to simplify mechanisation of field practices, depending on machinery and cultivated crops.\nNatural \/ human environment: Adopting agroforestry systems achieves several environmental benefits that have been widely demonstrated worldwide: regulation of nutrient cycling and adsorption of nonpoint source pollution (phytoremediation) thanks to the effect of deep rooting systems; reduction of soil surface erosion and sedimentation in rivers and lakes, improvement of micro-climate conditions, soil and ecosystem biodiversity. Reforestation of agroecosystems was recommended by Kyoto Protocol to mitigate global warming. Finally, agrisilviculture systems improve socio-cultural aspects as they contribute to differentiate and enrich the agricultural landscape.\nCOMMENTS:\nTrees\/ shrubs species: poplar, oak, walnut etc.\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soils in the low Venetian plain of the Veneto region generally suffer from a loss of soil organic matter (SOM) that is strongly affected by their natural texture and climatic conditions.

Indeed, in order to increase yields, strip intercropping is practiced: cereal crop (maize) is grown in association with pulse (food legumes): beans. Instead of using expensive commercial fertilizers, beans could facilitate maize growth due to the possible transfer of N during growth or after incorporation of the legume biomass, during the growth period of the cereal (Sangakkara et al., 2003). Furthermore, soil quality (e.g. soil structure) is improved because of the increased amount of humus and organic matter and a better soil cover helps in preventing splash erosion and increase soil moisture content and therefore fertility. Indeed, beans have a beneficial impact for weed control (probably due to the shadow effects) and soil moisture content (Worfswinkel, undated; Odhiambo and Ariga, 2001). Planting different crops helps to diversify production and family food supply. Concerning SWC, hillside ditches have been created at the top of each \u0027terrace\u0027 and trees are also planted nearby and Cassava (a drought resistant plant) at the bottom. Manure\/compost and organic fertilizers are supplied regularly both on maize\/grass (twice a year) and Bananas (once), as good soil management practice. A higher level of organic matter in the soil indicates reduced bulk density, improved soil structure, aeration and higher water holding capacity (Olabode et al., 2007), which altogether improve the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil (Haering and Evanylo, 2005). Bananas are planted in lines in the upper part of the land. The ditches, large 1m are excavated along the contour; they break slope into shorter segments  11 m long to intercept surface runoff. Ditches also help to prevent soil erosion and to avoid that nutrients and organic matter flow easily downwards into the river, instead they fall into the ditch. A live barrier of Napier grass is present above and below the edge of the five ditches, in two lines, to capture sediments and stabilize the structure, thus it is adequately protected. To conclude, a small area of the land is used to plant Napier grass only for fodder for grazing\nPurpose of the Technology: Maize and beans are cultivated for home consumption while Avocados and Bananas are planted for economic (commercial) purposes. Fruits are sold out to the middle-men directly from the house (not at the market), to reduce costs (e.g. transport) and time. Avocados are sold at about 2.5\/3 Ksh and Bananas at 200 Ksh. Grevillea trees are considered as saving, and sold out for timber production when the farmer is in need of cash, earning between 800 up to 1500 Ksh, depending on the size-lenght of the tree and the costs for cutting-transportation (e.g. machine operator). In general the selling of timber occurs per feet (running feet). \u2018Whole\u201d or standing tree is the preferred mode of selling trees from farms. Negotiation on sales is per tree \u2018standing on farm\u2019, with no processing or conversion. Buyers cut and cross cut, and carry timber from farms. Branches and slabs resulting from timber recoveries are left with the farmer depending on price negotiation; if the buyer carries these products then the price of the tree is adjusted upwards (Carsan and Holding , 2006; Holding et al., undated). Furthermore, the farmer underlined how \u0027bad prunings\u0027 at the top of the trees cause holes inside the trunks and thus a higher risk of fungi attacks and other diseases. The majority of the trees are planted along the boundaries of the land, for demarcation and only few are \u0027dispersed\u0027 on the cropland, to avoid excess of shadow to the cereal crop\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: High initial input to construct ditches and planting crop; manure also requires regular work: feeding cows and collect droppings and distribute them twice during the year, also over Napier grass. Dry planting is the preferred practice and the seeds are soaked the night before planting; this practice is advisable especially when the growing period is very short (Schmidt et al., 1983); organic fertilizers are applied over maize after 1 week and during the growing period (after about 18 days). Further maintenance is necessary after every rainy season to remove the sediments accumulated into the ditch and for pruning Grevillea, every three seasons. As mentioned above, pruning requires skills and knowledge to avoid plant diseases and labour is expensive because it is high risk work. The farmer trees plantation account for: 15 Avocados (from 4 seedlings), 100 Bananas (from cutting new suckers) and 50 Grevillea trees\nNatural \/ human environment: The area is characterized by rolling-hilly slope and highly exposed to erosion and land degradation: planting trees protect the soil from nutrients leaching and create a litter which reduces evaporation during dry seasons.

VegaThe agroforestry system of cacao crop planted under gallery forest is a private farmer initiative for family agriculture. The Crop is located in the gallery forest of Pozetas Stream, in the Cusiana River Basin. It is at the beginning of the Orinoco Floodable Savanas (250m a.s.l.). Municipality of Tauramena (Casanare), Colombia. \nThe cacao growths in an area of 4 hectares, being considered small farming, according to the Orinoco Regional scale. The  cacao density is 1080 plants\/hectare and the distance between plants is 3m. In this area, after tree thinning, the forest occupies 30% approximately. Some of the common tree species are Cedrus spp., Ficus spp. and Anadenanthera peregrina, among others.\nThe purpose of the technology is to use the gallery forest land in a productive way to generate income for the family, while keeping part of the forest. As cacao needs some shadow, specially in early growth stage, it is planted under the forest creating the agroforestry system.\nCacao seed germination and seedling preparation, gallery forest thinning and soil improvement with lime and organic fertilizer (rice husk), and finally planting, are the main establishment activities. Then the maintenance activities include cutting weeds, trimming cacao trees and fertilization every 2-3 months.\nThe cacao crop has produced fruits since the sixth year of being planted (2010) and is harvested every two weeks. It presents two yield peaks, the first one is in May-June and the second one in October-November. However it produces fruits along the year.\nThis technology provides additional income to the family, while conserving part of the original gallery forest. The more complex and diverse production system might favored pollination and crop health. The technology compared with other land uses around it such as oil palm tree and rice is more sustainable and it is something the land users prefer. They also like the value added to the cacao beens by processing their self the cacao beens to produce hand made 100% cacao bars for drinking chocolate.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe gallery forest should be protected according to the Colombian Environmental Legislation, however in most of the cases, its protections is in land users hands.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|Farm management|income increase|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 927, 910, 1180, 917, 914, 915, 921","readiness_level":"7.

To improve soil properties and crop production, organic manure is applied and a fallow system practiced. One part of the field is being cultivated with either millet (Pennisetum typhoides), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) or ma\u00efz (Zea mais] whereas the other part is left fallow for two years before rotation.\nPurpose of the Technology: Initially, the main objective of the land user applying the technology was to improve soil properties and crop production in his fields by maintaining any tree and protecting natural regeneration when preparing his land for cultivation. With the start of exploiting Acacia senegal for the exudates, gum arabic, the potential of revenue increase through gum exploitation became evident and the objective shifted from soil protection to gum exploitation.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Because of knowledge his father passed on to him, the land user applying this agroforestry practice believes that any tree in his fields is useful and should be protected.Through the technique of assisted natural regeneration, trees naturally growing in the field are protected to reach mature age instead of being cut to clear area for cultivation. The only inputs related to this technology are those for seeds for crop cultivation. During the 3-4 months of gum Arabic exploitation, the land user is obliged to survey his fields day and night, as intruders try to tap the Acacia senegal trees illegally. However, this task is fulfilled by the landuser himself and does not involve expenses for payed manpower.\nNatural \/ human environment: This SLM technology site is located in the sylvopastoral region of the Ferlo in the north of S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

Pastoralism is primarily practiced by transhumant Fula (Peulh) herders and further by Mauritanian Moor herders with herds of dromedaries. Vegetation cover in the area has been largely degraded due to cutting for domestic uses and cattle feeding, bushfires and overgrazing.

Cashew trees are grown in many tropical countries. The nutrition value of cashew nuts is high at about 500 calories per 100 gr. The first worthwhile harvest begins after 3 or 4 years (first yield 2.5 to 3 kilogram per tree) but can be started already with low yield after second year. But seven years after planting the yield of this evergreen tree remains constantly high nearly until it\u2019s cut down after 25 years. In 2017, fresh cashew nuts got 8500 riel per kilogram (Agritoday, 2017).\nAs main purposes of the peanut as intercrop between cashew trees can be seen in the reduction of weed at 50 percentage and in the increase of additional income (MoE,2016).\nMiss. Uth Vin living in the uplands of Preah Vihear province (Cambodia) is one of the farmers engaged in this agroforestry system. Before she started on some plots the land was degraded forest land. Firstly she converted it into a mono-cropping system (cassava, banana, mung bean, and soy bean). In 2016 she changed to cashew trees combined with peanuts.  \nThe main benefits of this intercropping system are:\n1. The technology meets the farmer\u2019s ultimate economic need of enough cultivable land, as - to a certain extent - also degraded land can be cultivated by this technique and thus, create yield to improve the household income.\n2. Before the farmers gets enough yields from cashew trees (after 3 years), peanuts provide them immediate income (yield after 3 month\/2 harvests). On one hectare, peanut can provide a net income of 3,000,000 Riel (4000 Riel per kilogram).\nAs peanuts need enough sunlight, the intercropping must be stopped after 3 years, because the branches of the cashew trees provide too much shadow that is not convenient to peanut growing.\nBeside the benefits already mentioned, the intercropping of peanut can improve soil fertility because the plant takes nitrogen from the air and \u0027\u0027fix\u0027\u0027 it into the soil via its roots and by support of Rhizobium bacteria. After harvesting, the plant residues are ploughed into the soil as organic fertilizer. Thus, it is a very important green manure, which reduces the application of chemical fertilizers. Weed control at the first years of cashew growing is important as well. This also can be attained by the peanut cover plantation on the ground. Last but not least, peanut and cashew trees are crops which prevent soil erosion by water.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|climate change adaptation|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 914, 916, 921, 917, 922, 915, 918, 926","readiness_level":"7.

The net result is seen in increased  soil erosion and decreasing soil fertility, leading to land degradation (MPWT et al., 2016). Thus, agroforestry is being promoted  based on its potential benefits through reducing soil erosion, increasing the economic returns, improved crop yields, improved soil fertility, and soil moisture. Agroforestry is the process of planting vegetables or other crops known as annual crops with long-term crops such as mango and orange trees (MoE et al., 2016).\nFarmers adopt agro-forestry intercropping as a technique for reducing the application of chemical fertilizers, more economic use of water and soil moisture, higher yields and higher income. Pineapple is a suitable crop for intercropping in the unused space between mango and oranges trees, because it is share tolerant and does not need much sunlight.  Pineapple is also resistance to water logging (for up to 7 days). Occasionally, the areas closest to rivers can become flooded for about 24 hours after periods of heavy rain. Often farmers who adopt the practice of intercropping  not use chemical fertilizers or pesticide because they rely on the potential benefits of crop residues, leaf material, small plants, and grass cutting. Normally, mango trees and oranges are the long-term crops, and when grown there is usually a large amount of unused spacing in the area where the trees are grown. If this area is not used for other crops, there is weed ingress which can be difficult to control. Therefore, the cultivation of pineapples in this space will provide an income source in the period before the mango and orange trees become productive. The intercropping also saves labour input for weed control and facilitates the maintenance of the land. Moreover, when mango trees and orange became mature trees, pineapples can continue to be grown as they are shade tolerant but little sunlight may of course lead to lower production. However, pineapples are a relatively new product for that locality\u0027s markets. \nAn examined block of land at Kouk Sralau Village, 2000 square meters in area (20 meters wide  and 100 meters long), contained 10 orange trees and 14 mango trees, and about 1000 pineapple plants. The mango trees were planted in two rows on both edges of the land (one row contained about 6 to 7 trees). The oranges were planted in the middle, and then the pineapples between the mango and orange trees. When planting the mango trees 0.5 meter holes were dug with a depth of half a meter. The distance between the mango trees was 15 meters.  Leaf and other waste materials that had been kept for about a year were used to fill the holes. The orange trees were planted in a small dike about 20 cm high and length 2m in square shape around the planting hole (the hole was the same size as mango\u0027s hole), with a 4 meter distance between the trees. The land was cultivated  during April or May and the trees planted after some rain. Weeding was needed in 3 to 4 months period after planting, and a year later cow manure was added to provide a source of organic nutrients.  The interrow planting of pineapple plants used a plant-to-plant interval of one meter (collate as triangles shape), with planting taking place into holes 20 cm wide and 10 cm deep. If deeper holes are used, often the pineapples will rot. As it normally takes 9 to 10 months before the pineapples can be harvested, only one pineapple crop is grown per year. After harvest, it took time about 1 to 2 month more before the copies growth (more than 10 leaves) bigger and ready as planting materials for the next plantation cycle. After, all pineapple residue is collected and buried in a part of the land to provide a later source of organic nutrients.\nCOMMENTS:\n\u1798\u17b6\u1793\u178a\u17c6\u178e\u17b6\u17c6\u179f\u17d2\u179c\u17b6\u1799 \u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17bc\u1785\u1796\u17c4\u1792\u17b7\u17cd\u179f\u17b6\u178f\u17cb \u1793\u17b7\u1784\u1798\u17d2\u1793\u17b6\u179f\u17cb\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1015","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|minimize pesticide use|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 914, 915, 916, 921, 926, 918, 917","readiness_level":"7.

Farmers plant such short term crops to support their family\u2019s income (Pov, 2016). Oranges are a long-term crop that can be fully harvested after six years and then continue to be harvested for a long time. The more the orange trees are mature, the more they are able to produce. Furthermore, they do not require a great deal of maintenance and there is a good market demand for oranges (CEDAC, 2011). Growing chilies between young orange trees is known as an agro-forestry system that gives rise to a great number of benefits including an increase in the efficiency of land use, a saving of time otherwise spent on maintenance and irrigation, and also it improves the soil quality and prevents land degradation. Moreover it is an improvement in crop production that helps to generate more income for farmers (ECHO, 2007).\nThe purpose of implementing this technology, whereby other short-term crops (such as chilies, eggplants, and herbs) are seasonally intercropped between young orange trees is to economize time spent on maintenance, watering, and applying fertilizer on chilies. And oranges benefit, too. Assorted crops absorb different nutrients from the soil which enables the soil to remain balanced and fertile and also they do not interfere with the growth of the long-term crop. Additionally the use of crop residue with cow manure is a mean of improving the soil\u2019s fertility and it helps to reduce the use of chemical fertilizer. Alternatively this technology can also include the plantation of papaya and banana trees around the land as additional crops, which provide shade and help to control soil moisture for the other crops.\nThe farmer needs to plough the soil three times. After the first ploughing the soil has to be dried for four days, after the second ploughing for five days and after the final ploughing it should be dried seven days.  If there is additional rainfall then extra days will be needed to get the soil dry. After that, holes need to be dug at a distance of 3.5 meters from each other in any direction. Each hole measures 30 X 40 centimeters and is 30 centimeters in depth. .  Before the orange trees are planted the soil should be mixed with compost, consisting of vegetables or crop residue and cow manure. Twenty-five to thirty days after the chilies have sprouted they should be planted between the trees in a row with a gap of 1.2 meters and a distance of one meter from side to side. 2 month later the around 270 chilies plants are able to produce a yield of around 50 to 60 kg.. Once they are four to five months old, 100 to 200 kg can be harvested every 15 days for a period of 6 months. The market price of chilies is between 2000 to 4000 riel per kilogram.\nOne of the main advantages stated by the land user is to be able to balance the land shortage by using all of free space within the orange orchard. Another advantage is that weeds have less chance to grow. This saves labor time and generates better income. Due to crop rotation (different seasonal crops) he can maintain a good soil quality through a balanced absorption of the soil nutrients.\nCOMMENTS:\nApplied on land of 36m \u00d7 60m= 2160 square meters.Oranges trees, chili and other short-term crops like eggplants and herbs.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1197, 1200, 1206","use_cases":"NO USE CASE IDENTIFIED","use_cases_id":"1190","readiness_level":"7.

Despite this, production is low, due to poor cultivation techniques, reflected in an estimated production of approximately 25 tons ha\/year. In addition, the national production of guava is below potential. Among the technological limitations registered, there is high heterogeneity in production systems, due to the fact that guava is produced both in silvopastoral areas and as specialized orchard crops. It is estimated that at least 28% of the production costs of the crop correspond to fertilizers, and only 5% of farmers use soil analysis to guide fertilization regimes. This affects the profitability, competitiveness, and environmental sustainability of the crop. For optimal impact, the following practices must be combined during the productive phase (4-5 years):\nTop pruning: this is applied 15 days after the last harvest and determines the beginning of the productive cycle and development stages of the crop. \nFertilization: should be based on technical criteria according to soil analysis and crop requirements. For high fertility soils, per tree, rates of 150g N, 170g P, and 145g K with minor elements according to soil analysis. This should be complemented with 20 kg of composted organic matter distributed over three periods during the crop cycle. \nIrrigation: based on the daily balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration, in periods or areas with water deficit, water corresponding to 100 % of the reference evapotranspiration should be applied to each tree. \nThese agronomic guidelines improve production by 40% due to the combined effect of practices that contribute to the efficient use of resources and natural capital. It also contributes to the generation of technological packages and resilient production systems framed in efficient SLM within production areas.

The technology presented here provides an economically sound solution for soil and water conservation. In this example, Alfalfa is grown in the spaces between the young trees to make use of the soil, light and water. The soil and water conservation quality of the technology is further enhanced with terracing to capture water.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of establishing the fruit orchard with Alfalfa was to produce fruits for both\nconsumption and income, as well as for animal fodder. Terraces are important for retaining soil moisture, reducing soil erosion and preventing nutrient leaching. Alfalfa increases soil fertility as it fixes\nnitrogen.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The area under this specific technology is less than 0.03 ha. The technology was established by the land user five years ago without external support. In the past, the site was sloping agriculture land used for potato and wheat cultivation, the two major staple crops in Bamyan. Animal manure, with small quantities of chemical fertilizers, were used to maintain the soil fertility. The farmer, Haji Hussain, learning from similar examples from Kabul, applied this technology on his private land\nwith sight modifications by including terraces for soil and water conservation. For the construction of one terrace, 14 person days are needed. The size of one terrace was about 43 m in length and 4 m in width.Initially the terraces were used for vegetable cultivation. Later on, he planted mainly apple and apricot trees and a few saplings of pear and plum. Two varieties of apple (red and yellow) were planted in the orchard and the distance between two trees in a row was about 3 m (for more details, please see the technical drawing). The saplings were prepared by the farmer himself using grafting. The trees vary in age, from 3-5 years. Alfalfa was planted 1-3 years ago. The farmer applies 1 kg urea and DAP per tree every spring in addition to a small quantities of manure. The orchard requires irrigation almost every week from mid-spring to autumn from a nearby canal. The water distribution and operation and maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure is regulated by a Mirab, or \u201cWater Master\u201d, elected by the water users and farmers.\nNatural \/ human environment: Bamyan Center has temperate and semi-arid climate with an average annual rainfall of about 230 mm. The area receives snow during the winter season and the temperature can drop below -20 degree centigrade.There is one growing season from April to September. The soil in the orchard is sandy loam with moderate soil fertility. Orchards are considered to be more profitable by the land user than growing crops like wheat and potato.

However, between 1960 and 2000, the restructuring of agricultural land, and technical and technological developments, have led to the disappearance of agroforestry in Normandy. Since the beginning of the 21 century, the integration of trees into the system has started to be reintroduced, not only in grassland systems, but also in crop fields.\nThe integration of trees into the system is effective for countering:\n- Biological degradation: by enhancing biodiversity though improved refuge for insects and birds, providing food for them, breeding opportunities and connectivity corridors across the landscape. This leads to greater biological regulation of crop pests among other benefits.\n- Climate related stress: both at the local level (decrease of wind speeds, reduction of evapotranspiration, shade for animals) and at the global level (carbon storage, substitution of fossil energies by renewable energy).\n- Water degradation: through the qualitative and quantitative regulation of water at the watershed scale as a benefit of improved rainfall infiltration and less fertilizer lost in runoff.\n- Soil erosion by water and chemical deterioration: through the conservation of soils with reduced runoff.\n- Soil erosion by wind: through the protection of exposed areas.\nand:\n- Providing benefits through beautification of the living environment.\nAs part of the agroforestry SLM technology, trees are planted on grassed strips which are 24 to 30 m apart within the field of cereals. Trees are spaced 8 to 10 m within the strips. This configuration has been adapted to allow mechanized agriculture. The main tree species used are Quercus, Sorbus, Tilia, Prunus and Robinia. Land users, with some support from the local community, financed the re-introduction of agroforestry into Normandy. Soil was prepared using machinery (single line ploughing), mulch was applied and tree seedlings were protected against wild animals.\nDespite these financial and management benefits. the SLM technology has not yet been taken up widely. Therefore, the aim is to promote better adoption of agroforestry practices by Normandy farmers. This is becoming more important as the use of external inputs (e.g. fertilizers and pesticides) is increasingly expensive for both farmers and society - and the introduction of agroforestry can both help reduce these costs with more natural pest control and less runoff of fertilisers from the fields.\nThe compilation of this SLM is a part of the European Interreg project FABulous Farmers which aims to reduce the reliance on external inputs by encouraging the use of methods and interventions that increase the farm\u2019s Functional AgroBiodiversity (FAB).

Owned by a local farmer, the farm covers a total of 7.8 hectares. In 2018, this land was allocated for the Farm Life project, transforming it into agroforestry system. The farm integrates natural and agricultural elements, creating a sustainable environment where trees (chestnuts), crops, and pasture co-exist.\nThe agroforestry system on this farm is utilized for multiple purposes, including chestnut tree cultivation, agriculture, horticulture, and pasture. This diverse planting strategy allows the farmer to mix crop production with tree cultivation, where each component supports soil health and ecological balance. Chestnut trees, for example, are grown alongside mainly grasses, introducing perennial elements to the farm and diversifying the landscape.\nAgroforestry merges natural ecosystems with agriculture, creating a system where nature actively enhances farm productivity. It allows farmers to move beyond monoculture farming by incorporating trees and shrubs into crop systems, promoting biodiversity as an essential part of farming. For example, integrating chestnut trees into these systems improves soil health, reduces erosion (as these are mainly sandy soils), and strengthens the farm\u2019s resilience to environmental stress. This approach also creates income from products like chestnuts, which supports sustainable food production\u2014a primary motivation for the farmer.\nThis agroforestry system, while beneficial, faces challenges in implementation and scaling-up. For example, perennial food crops are not yet commonly integrated into modern agroforestry systems, which limits their full potential. Establishing a guide on cultivation practices and securing better funding would be key steps to upscaling agroforestry production and making it more accessible. Additionally, adequate resources and guidance on plant selection, tree management, and harvesting methods would make it easier for farmers to adopt and sustain these practices.\nSpecifically to this agroforestry, compared to traditional fruit trees like apples and pears, chestnut trees require less intensive management\u2014reducing labor as they naturally drop fruit and need less pruning. They also enhance biodiversity and can be financially beneficial. As a perennial carbohydrate source, chestnuts offer a sustainable, low-maintenance crop option that aligns with modern food production goals. Additionally, they can help revitalize traditional orchard landscapes and accelerate returns from forest areas through nut production, contributing to long-term ecological and economic benefits.\nWhile agroforestry offers many environmental benefits, land users face several challenges. Initial investments in tree planting, maintenance, and management can be costly, and limited access to financial support often discourages smallholder farmers from adopting these practices. Some farmers also find the high diversity of species in agroforestry systems to be complex and challenging for achieving consistent product yields. There are also limitations in technology suited for small-scale agroforestry, such as a shortage of plant materials (e.g., seedlings) and limited guidance on establishing and maintaining agroforestry systems. On the positive side, farmers appreciate agroforestry\u2019s contributions to a sustainable environment. The increased organic matter and diversity, improve soil health and crop productivity, and build resilience against environmental stressors, which makes agroforestry an option for long-term land management.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Integrated management systems|Species diversification|Agroforestry carbon credits|Carbon credits|Financial","type_id":"993, 1196, 1197, 1200, 1062, 1059, 1058","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|forestry management|improving soil management practices|income increase|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 927, 921, 1180, 918, 919, 910, 914, 915, 922","readiness_level":"7.

The cattle consume crop residues and weeds (including some grass) on the farm and they produce dung and urine in turn, which increases nitrogen content and organic matter in the soil. This enhances its fertility and makes it more productive for the next round of crop cultivation. The crops grown are mainly annuals including maize, beans, soybeans and groundnuts.

Terracing is a traditional and well-known technique of cultivating crops on the slopes, therefore local timber enterprise have enough experience in creating such terraces. An isolated agroforestry area is fenced off by livestock damage. The technology has been applied as part of the GEF \/ FAO project \u201cDecision Support for Mainstreaming and Scaling out Sustainable Land Management (GEF-FAO \/ DS-SLM)\u201d (DS-SLM) (2015-2018)\nMeasures on implementation, inputs, and costs:\nThe technology includes the following activities:\n1. Plowing, harrowing, soil leveling.\n2. Small sloping terraces are created manually. The width of the terraces is 1 m, the distance between the seedlings is 5 m.\n3. Creating a fence for the site.\n4. Planting seedlings (in March) according to the scheme 5 mx 5 m.\n5. Planting care includes:\n- primitive drip irrigation using polyethylene bottles (first 2-3 years).\n- fertilizer application (manure, composts)\n- measures to control pests and diseases. In early spring (before the appearance of buds), trees are treated against pests with copper sulfate (ratio of 100-150 grams per 10 liters of water). Trunks of trees are treated with lime in March. Space between rows are treated with 57% of  Fufanon at the rate of 0.6-1.0 l \/ ha, or 30% benzophosphate at the rate of 2.0-2.3 kg \/ ha to destroy root-gnawing caterpillars of beetles.\nTotal cost for establishment of the Technology is quite high, which is a limiting factor for its wide distribution. The main costs associated with the initial period (development of terraces, purchase and planting of seedlings). Hereinafter costs are reduced because there is no need for watering, weed distribution is reduced as a result of competitive relation with older trees\nNatural and human environment.\nLow precipitation is a feature of rainfed farming within the Technology area.\nTerritories under rainfed agriculture suffer from a lack of natural moisture and are subject to water and wind erosion. Climate and weather determine low and unstable productivity of winter wheat, which is traditionally grown on rainfed lands. Drought resistant crops such as sophlor are used to increase the productivity of rainfed lands. Rainfed and livestock farming are the main land use types for the local population. Finding alternative solutions and supporting the local community is essential for improving living standards and well-being. The development of plantations using drought-resistant fruit trees on sloping rainfed lands will increase land productivity of rainfed lands and the income of the local population engaged in agriculture. The Technology also provides environmental benefits - preventing soil erosion, mitigating the effects of climate change through sequestration of CO2 in woody biomass and soil, and contributes to the overall improvement of the environment.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1203, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change mitigation|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Farm management|income increase|field management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 919, 918, 921, 922, 910, 1180, 914, 917, 926","readiness_level":"7.

The long-term mean annual temperature is 13.5\u00bac and long-term mean annual rainfall is 510 mm. The landforms of the study area are generally rolling (with slope 8-16%) and medium mountain ridges (with slope 16-30%). The site study is located between 2000 and 2700m above sea level. The average depth of the soil in this region is 50cm. Dominant top soil textures are sandy loam, loam, and sandy clay loam and are commonly shallow with low amounts of organic matter (usually below1% ).

The technology is applied in subhumid and semi-arid areas, on steep slopes with shallow soils, a poor vegetation cover and high soil erosion rates. These areas are generally used by poor subsistence farmers for rainfed agriculture with crops such as maize and beans, which are considered inappropriate for such slope angles. On slopes steeper than 30% the living barriers are often combined with stone walls (width 40-50 cm; height 80-90 cm). The plants stabilize the stone risers, making this combined technology one of the most efficient measures for soil erosion control on the Cape Verde Islands.\nNatural \/ human environment: The herbaceous plant is well adapted to the local biophysical conditions and to the land use system: it can be grown with any crop, is available for any farmer, establishment and transport are simple, its green leaves are not palatable for livestock, the plant is extremely resistant to water stress and grows on any bioclimatic zone on the island.

The imbalance amount of water, either in deficit or excess, might affect the development and productivity of the crops.\nWith this inefficient water use and coupled by the increasing frequency of drought, vulnerability to water scarcity is inevitable. Furthermore, it has been recognized that poor water management practices contributed to the process of land degradation. Hence, there is a need to practice proper water management in rice cultivation. As an integral part of the Palayamanan system, the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) introduced a water saving technology to the farmers called Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD).\nThe AWD modifies the irrigation scheduling and application and eventually the amount of water to be use in the field. Irrigation water is applied a few days after the disappearance of the ponded water in the so-called \u201cobservation well\u201d. Hence, the field is alternately flooded and non-flooded.\nPurpose of the Technology: The following are the purpose of this technology: (1)reducing water use for irrigation so that it can be used for other purposes, (2) reducing the use of irrigation water because there is less of it, and (3) reducing the use of irrigation water to reduce the cost. Emission of greenhouse gas (GHG) specifically on methane is reduced since this is caused by flooding of ricefields.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Practical implementation of AWD is facilitated using a simple tool called a \u0027field water tube\u0027 as observation well, used in monitoring the water level in the field.It is made of a 25 cm long PVC pipe with a diameter of 10 to 15 cm. In some instances, bamboo can be used instead of the PVC pipe. The pipe is perforated with many holes on all sides to allow lateral movement of water in the root zone.  It is installed into the soil by ensuring that 10 (dry season) or 5 (wet season) cm protrudes above the soil surface. Soil must be removed inside the tube so that the bottom is visible. During the first 21 to 30 days after direct seeding or transplanting, 2 to 3 cm of water is maintained to control weeds and to ensure that the crop has already\nrecovered from transplanting shock. AWD is imposed after 21 to 30 days where the water in the tube is monitored. Once the water inside the tube disappears, irrigation is applied to a water depth of 5 cm above soil surface. It is noted that during fertilizer application and flowering stage, sufficient water is maintained to avoid spikelet sterility. Terminal drainage from one to two weeks before the expected time of harvest is also done to promote uniform maturity of the crop and to facilitate easement of post-harvest operations in the field.\nNatural \/ human environment: The area is under a humid climate experiencing wet and dry season with an annual average rainfall ranging from 1000-1500 mm per year. The technology was applied to irrigated rice field in flat and plain areas.\nCOMMENTS:\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): lack of irrigation water\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change mitigation|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 920, 919, 910, 914, 909, 915","readiness_level":"7.

This region is the hottest region of the country where water scarcity is a common problem. The annual precipitation is 1410 mm and the farmer is habituated to use deep tubewell underground water for their crops operated by Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA). Rice is the common crop in this region and in Boro season (from November to March) rice consumed the lion share of underground water through flood irrigation. And this flood irrigation system is very traditional cultivation method resulting the underground water table is consistently going down for heavy extraction by shallow or deep tube-well.\nIt is not always necessary to keep standing water in rice fields for its maximum production like aquatic plant. To address these problems \u2018Alternate Wetting and Drying\u2019 is a good choice, because  it is not necessary to keep the water standing throughout the whole growing season of Boro rice (wet rice). In this method 20-25% less water is consumed, which may save approximately USD 30 per hectare. \nAfter 10-15 days of transplanting of rice seedling shallow standing water can be allowed and then the field can be drained and wetted alternately. To implement this method, first a perforated plastic pipe is installed to examine the water level and irrigate the rice field when necessary. The 25 cm long and 7-10 cm diameter perforated pipe is installed vertically. Only the lower 15 cm of the pipe should be perforated so that water can enter and exit, and then the pipe should be installed so that the non-perforated portion remains above the ground to protect it from debris.  \nIn a leveled rice field of one hectare, seven to eight pipes are enough to monitor water depth. 10-15 days after seedling transplanting the AWD method can start. In each irrigation, the water level should reach 5-7 cm from the above the soil in wetting regime, and when the water level goes down to the soil level in drying regime, then the field can be irrigated again. This can continue until the panicle initiation stage. Then from panicle initiation to the milking stage, the field should be irrigated with 2-4 cm of water (also wetting regime). After the milking stage, the AWD can be continued until two weeks before harvesting from April to May (depending on rice variety).\nPromotion of AWD in Bangladesh has been piloted and tested by different organisations like Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI), Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA) and Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) during 2008 to 2010. In HBT, the quantity of groundwater is continuously decreasing, so farmers applied AWD without installing the pipe. The farmers are experienced with this technology long-ago and know that the cracks appeared when the groundwater goes down to 18-20 cm below soil surface. When the farmers saw the \u0022hair like crack\u0022 in their rice field, they irrigated. BMDA introduced the pre-paid card for irrigation, so the farmer irrigated his rice field several times when he saw the field cracks. The aim is to save money as well as to save groundwater.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe land user use this technology in their rice field\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|climate change adaptation|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 920, 910, 914, 909, 918, 912","readiness_level":"7.

This idea was initiated by local people who have been living with natural resources including forests, mountains and streams for generations. Their idea was to optimize these resources \u2013 namely the land and water to fish raising in the rice field at the same time. In the past, people were dependent on shifting cultivation. However, they recently switched to lowland rice cultivation because shifting cultivation for upland rice cultivation is insufficient for household consumption and against government policy for natural environment conservation; whatever the farmer still keep the upland rice cultivation in burned area but no allow to expand the new area. Raising fish in a rice paddy is an important technique to encourage permanent land use. It should be initiated in an appropriate environment especially one where there is water supply throughout the year. The rice paddy should be located along a stream, a river or an irrigation canal so that the water can be adequately channeled both in and out of the field. Ta-Oy is a district where there is limited productive agricultural land with most of the rice paddies being situated along mountain valleys and at the base of the hills. In this area agricultural activities rely entirely on natural rainfall. The creation of rice fields requires a considerable amount of labour from local households or otherwise a tractor needs to be hired to clear the area along the mountain valleys. Basically, rice paddy development in such areas requires the construction of small dykes in cross sections of the stream channel. Ground levelling may be required to ensure that the water reaches all of the plots. Typically, these paddy fields are arranged in a terraced formation. Raising fish in rice fields may require different methods from those of traditional rice paddies as there need to be appropriate measures taken in order to prevent natural disasters, particularly soil erosion. Rice fields that are suitable for fish raising need to have higher levees built around them and be equipped with an appropriate drainage system. The farmer also needs to construct deep retention water in the pond next to the rice field so as to regulate the water from the canal flow directly to rice field, which helps to reduce levees erosion. The integrated rice-fish system sets out to maximize land use as it enables both rice production and the raising of fish thereby providing increased food security for households as well as improving their income. In order to apply the technology, farmers need drainage pipes which are installed on levees to leveling the water in rice fields that are a part of the irrigation system. Other production inputs include the rice variety, fish fingerlings, knifes, hoes, spades, shovels and sickles. Both of these activities are mutually beneficial because the food waste and suspended nutrients in the water resulting from the fish waste provide a natural fertilizer for the rice and this also enhances the soil\u2019s fertility, whilst at the same time the rice stalks provide a habitat for the fish. When pests or insects threaten the rice crop, fish fulfill the role of consuming them. The practice of raising fish in rice paddies also helps to reduce water pollution due to the process of eutrophication through fertilization, even though process of decaying is loss of oxygen production but it can be regenerated by phytoplankton\u2019s photosynthesis and water sources recharge . In fact, the technology reduces expenses and labour required for the cultivation of rice and at the same time preserves the environment, as the soil is moist throughout the year. This technology is very pragmatic for farmers as it allows them to provide sufficient rice and fish for their families\u2019 needs. Benefits also include increased productivity in comparison to shifting cultivation which provided insufficient outputs and farmers often experienced rice shortages. Farmers can now cultivate rice for two seasons. Another benefit are the nutrients and the decay from fish faeces which become a natural fertilizer for the rice and add microorganisms to the soil. An integrated rice-fish system can be implemented in an area of 500 sqm (25m x 20m), with a water depth of 0.5 \u2013 1 m and a gradient between 3 - 5% which is similar to that of terraced rice paddies. The space between rows of rice stems should be 20 \u2013 25cm with an open area for the fish without any rice plants approximately 5 square meters from the levee to the field where there is a water pipe to generate oxygen for fishes. The fish population should be at a density of five fish per square meter, and suitable species include Pa pak (Barbonymus gonionotus), tilapia and Pa kheng (Anabas testudineus).Strengths: (1) An increase in rice production in a smaller area because the farmer is able to cultivate rice for two seasons as well as in fish production (both a dry season and a rain fed rice crop). (2) An integrated fish culture maximizes the agricultural land. (3) Nutrients and fish faeces are essential for rice as well as add microorganisms to the soil. (4) Raising fish in a rice field provides a good return and optimizes land use. Weaknesses (1) A lack of funds to implement this technology \u2013 farmers need some source of funding. (2) It has been implemented traditionally without any technical knowledge \u2013there is the need for farmers to receive technical advice regarding the maintenance of a rice-fish system as well as land management. (3) The need for appropriate equipment to implement the production process. (4) If the fish population density is too high, it might affect the health of the rice. (5) It is not possible to propagate an adequate number of fish fingerlings for the next year in the existing rice-fish system, an individual nursery pond for propagation is required.\nCOMMENTS:\nLivestock density: 5 fishes\/m2\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation|Low-cost farming tools and techniques","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1197, 1206, 1076, 1088, 1089","use_cases":"Production|crop production|fisheries products management|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 900, 910, 914, 909, 1180, 916, 917, 920, 921, 918","readiness_level":"7.

The organic matter from these processes aggregate the soil while the movement of soil organisms like worms and termites loosen the soil. This is called biological tillage and replaces mechanical tillage. The untilled soil surface covered by residues will require a planter specialized to plant in these conditions. In a sense, adopting zero-till does actually require a zero-till planter. The development of the strip-planter has made zero-till a viable option for animal draft farmers, which until now was not possible due to the unavailability or high cost of zero-till planters. The new planter is both cheap and easy to manufacture locally. The planter uses a narrow tine to open a planting furrow and seed\/fertilizer is metered by vertically rotating plates. The planter is pulled by oxen and can plant rows of 75cm or 90cm rows with an intra-row which is determined by the seed plate used (3, 4, 5,\u2026\u2026 seeds\/m). The planting technology needs to be complemented with sound residue cover and weeding management practices.\nPurpose of the Technology: The planter enables planting and fertilizing in untilled soil so that the soil residue cover and soil structure are preserved and can be used sustainably. The protective soil cover reduces evaporation and enhances infiltration while the improved soil structure and organic matter content increases soil water storage making zero tillage an important drought mitigating strategy. The immediate benefits of adopting zero-till are the possibility to plant a bigger area quickly and in time as well as the reduced soil erosion.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The first step in establishing zero-till is to assess the soil condition and levels of degradation. Where possible tests should be carried out but where not, the farmer needs to start on a small plot to check if there will be yield reduction from not tilling the soil. Where soils are severely degraded, an establishment phase should be embarked on where reduced tillage is practiced until the soil structure has recovered sufficiently to support crop growth without tillage. Liming acidic soils followed by a final ploughing will be required in the first year to correct the soil pH which otherwise will be difficult to correct once conservation tillage has been established. The organic matter levels need to be increased by increasing the amount of residues produced by the crop (i.e. the yields) and retaining these as soil cover. The next establishment activity is the purchase of the planter unit. Maintenance activities include planting and fertilizing in the same operation and weeding. Weeding will have to involve herbicide use to handle increased weed densities implying that spraying will become a major operation. In addition to the normal conventional inputs, herbicides will also become a major input and cost.\nNatural \/ human environment: Zero-till has been applied in a wide range of bio-physical environments but mostly by the large scale farmers. The unavailability and high cost of specialized zero-till planter for small-scale farming has resulted in low adoption rates. The development of the Magoye Planter creates new opportunities for this practice.

Animal manure application contributes to the build-up of soil organic matter and supplies most of the required nutrients, both of which ultimately improve soil health and productivity. Additionally, manure improves the soil\u2019s water holding capacity, improves soil structure, resulting into improved water infiltration and reduced runoff.\nAnimal manure is applied on citrus trees at the Green Valley Enterprise farm located in Adjumani District found in Northern Uganda. The farm lies on a gentle slope in an area with predominantly sandy soils. This area experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern with an annual average of 1000 mm. The farm is strategically located close to River Adidi, which is used to provide water for irrigation during the dry months. The purpose of animal manure application on the citrus trees is to increase soil fertility and health, thus improving fruit quality and quantity. Since the soils on the farm are sandy, the land user needs to have a good soil fertility and water management plan in place.\nAt the beginning of every cropping season, 70 bags of animal manure from cows, each weighing about 100 kg are bought and applied on over 111 citrus trees planted on an acre of land. The citrus trees are a mixture of Washington navel and Hamlin, planted at a spacing of 6\u00d76 m. Before application, the animal manure is collected, heaped and left to decompose under shade at the owner\u2019s kraal for 4 months.  At the farm, the manure is applied using the ring method, that is, 60 cm radius from the tree trunk and covered with grass mulch. Forty (40) kg of the manure is applied per tree per season. Application of the animal manure on one acre is estimated to cost UGX 540,000, while maintenance costs are estimated to be UGX 50,000 per season.\nAt this farm, animal manure application has increased citrus fruit yields up to seven folds. When covered with grass mulch it improves soil moisture retention, hence the farmer is able to have two major harvests annually. In addition, the trees on which manure is applied are more tolerant to dry spells. The main disadvantages of use of animal manure are intensive labour requirement for handling, and variability in manure quality depending on the source.\nCOMMENTS:\n3.52880,32.00569 is located in Adjumani District, Northern Uganda.\nThe manure is applied in this case around the citrus trees 60cm away from the tree trunk.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 910, 914, 909, 920, 918","readiness_level":"7.

This sustainable land management technology was established on agricultural land in Mutxamel (region of Alicante) in the municipality of Valencia (Comunidad Valenciana), Spain. Agricultural production in this region is of a very high quality and is intensely competitive. Despite this, the region\u2019s traditional agriculture industry is nonetheless being overtaken by other sectors, with the scarcity of water emerging as a key factor in this shift. The main orchards in this region are: citrus, lemon, almonds and olives trees, other common crops are vegetables, such as tomatoes, lettuce, etc.\n2. The SLM technology focuses on annual cultivation of green manure in the form of the plant of Phacelia tanacetifolia. Phacelia tanacetifolia (Hydrophyllaceae) is commonly known as Lacy or Tancy Phacelia (syn. Purple Tancy, Fiddleneck and Valley Velvenia). Native to Californian drylands, chaparral and Central oak woodland, P. tanacetifolia has been naturalised throughout the western United States and frequently in Europe, whereas it has been extensively used as a nectar crop up and as annual green manure worldwide. Phacelia is listed as one of the top 20 honey-producing flowers for honeybees and is very rich in both nectar and pollen the lavender-coloured flowers attract bees, butterflies and other pollinating insects.\n3. Initially, the main objective of the land user applying the technology was to improve the soil quality and the crop production in the vegetable fields (cabbages, tomatoes, lettuce, chards, spinach) by cultivating the Phacelia plant as an annual green manure. In other words, the maintenance of a specific cover crop such as Phacelia tanacetifolia grown in the orchard is intended to add organic matter, nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous and other nutrients coming from the decomposed manuring plant after it is worked into the soil.\n4. The land user prepares the soil during September or October by ploughing the surface of soil and then sowing the Phacelia tanacetifolia seed thinly at a rate of 1 gram per square meter and within 25 cm per plant. In the examined case, the land user installed a drip irrigation system to irrigate every two to three days in autumn or every three to four days in winter. During winter time it is recommended to remove manually spontaneous plants. Before seed formation (February or March) the land user cuts the plant and then he is tilling and digging the cover crop gently into the soil, in order to incorporate all the nutrients of this green manure into the soil. It is crucial to cut the plant before seed formation; otherwise the nutrient capacity to the soil is reduced.\n5. The major benefit of the intercrop of Phacelia tanacetifolia is the short term enhancement of the soil organic content. It keeps the soil more fertile during one year and therefore it has to be cultivated every year. In consequence also an improvement of the orchard productivity has been determined. Other substantial benefits are the stronger N fixation, the decrease in weeds, and the improved water-holding capacity; further to be mentioned,  the better soil aggregation, as green manure crops help to improve the soil structure over time, and by this the aeration increases, and water infiltration and root growth are enhanced. Finally, the improved soil cover helps to control the risk of soil erosion.\n6. One major disadvantage is the fact that Phacelia is not polyvalent. It is only an annual green manure plant, but unfortunately not also a marketable crop that could create monetary benefits in addition. Other disadvantages mentioned by the land user are the relative high establishment expenses, as for example for the irrigation equipment and as well the maintenance costs.\nCOMMENTS:\nMain crops (cash and food crops): Phacelia Tanacetifolia as a green manure to prepare the soil to rotation crops: cabbages, tomatoes, lettuce, chards, spinach.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|optimization of resource use for better production|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|Farm management|field management|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 917, 909, 920, 918, 910, 914, 922, 926","readiness_level":"7.

This should be achieved through a combination of structural measures such as stone rows, and biological measures such as revegetation and agroforestry.\nThe EKF project carries out four types of land improvement techniques:\nContour stone rows, permeable rock dams, permeable rock dikes as well as the treatment of gully erosion. In order to strengthen their performance, these structures are vegetated with grasses (Andropogon gayanus, Cymbopogon sp, Vetiveria zizanioides) or tree species (Jatropha curcas, Acacia nilotica, Agave sisalana).\nWorking groups are created for the construction and maintenance.\nThe described measures help to protect the land against erosion caused by runoff, by slowing down runoff and spreading it over the land. In this way the structures increase water infiltration and not only help to act against erosion caused by runoff (thereby preventing the loss of rainwater), but also increase sedimentation and act as a filter by keeping waterborne particles on the land. In areas of erratic rainfall, these measures help to conserve soil moisture. \nVegetation helps to stabilize the structures and is furthermore an effective measure to protect the land against water and wind erosion.  The right grass or tree species must be chosen to ensure the longevity of the structures.

Riparian forests along the Tarim River Basin have been reduced and degraded by the expansion of irrigated agriculture since the 1950s. The main crop planted is cotton. In the arid temperate cold desert climate, precipitation is very low and evaporation high. The only water source for the region is the Tarim River. Xinjiang is being promoted to become the main cotton production area of China, especially in the upper reaches of the Tarim River, and reservoirs with a large irrigation infrastructure have been established. Farmers water their fields with flood and drip irrigation. But most of the fields have no drainage system. With the high evaporation and the capillary rise of the shallow groundwater, salts dissolved in the water accumulate on the soil surface and in the soil. This salinization makes the fields unusable for cotton production and are abandoned as farmers move on. These barren saline soils are prone to wind erosion, as almost no plants can grow on them. Large-scale desertification is the result.\nPurpose of the Technology: To halt desertification the barren saline soils need to be protected by vegetation to avoid soil loss by wind. But if this can be done through vegetation that yields an income then the advantage is double: a win-win situation. Apocynum venetum and Apocynum pictum are indigenous and both are drought and salt tolerant. They are phreatophytes: deep-rooted plants that tap groundwater or the soil layer just above the water table. A.venetum and A. pictum are rhizomatous perennials \u2013 and importantly they are cash crops too. Fibre from the stems are used to produce textiles, though the extraction process is time and labor consuming. The advantage of apocynum yarn is that it has antibacterial properties. The leaves and flowers are also sold and used to produce tea which is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that reduces blood pressure. On a per hectare basis, the stem generates a potential income of US$ 3,650, the leaves US$ 1,995, and the flowers US$ 1,815: nevertheless the market for apocynum products is small. In Xinjiang most of the apocynum plantations are under commercial large-scale farmers. They have the capital to deal with the costly establishment of apocynum.\nNatural \/ human environment: Fields on which apocynum is sown should have a groundwater level not deeper than 2m. Nevertheless the soil should be well-drained: best is a sandy loam. Waterlogged, calcareous, clayey soils are not suitable. Apocynum can withstand periods of water inundation; however, prolonged submergence or waterlogging inhibits its growth. The topsoil under apocynum is often saline, reaching salt contents of up to 20%. Apocynum can grow on sites with a pronounced surface salinization, as long as the subsoil and the groundwater are not strongly salinized. There are two methods of planting apocynum: by seed or by vegetative means. While irrigation helps establishment and good yields, this is at a much lower level than for cotton. In conclusion, A.venetum and A. pictum provide profitable options on saline soils, grow with minimal irrigation, and protect the land against wind erosion.\nCOMMENTS:\nBoundary points of the Technology area: Location in China between 37\u00b0~46\u00b0N and 76\u00b0~104\u00b0E.

Preparation 500 application in agricultural soils under a biodynamic management is applied in a flat orchard of 40 ha located in Jumilla in southeastern Spain. It is sited in the north east of the Murcia region, on the Altiplano area, close to the towns of Cieza and Yecla. This area has an important agricultural activity where the main plantations are vineyards, but as well orchards of different mediterranean fruits. Jumilla is a Spanish Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen (DO) for wines that extends over the north of the region of Murcia.\n2. This technology  is based on the application of the preparation number 500, commonly known as cow horn manure. Preparation 500 is made by filling a cow\u0027s horn with cow dung every year, and burying it in the soil during the cooler months  (November  through February). The horns should be buried open end down so that they will not become water logged if the pit is over watered. When the preparation is ready after 4 months it should have turned into dark humus. It should then be stored in a cool place and in glazed, isolated pots. It is sprayed up to four times a year. The best times are in October and November and then again in February and March. It is stirred for one hour making a vortex. The Horn Manure preparation 500 should be diluted in good-quality rainwater that has been properly stored. The preparation is then stirred vigorously for exactly one hour before spraying. The water should be heated before stirring, ideally to body temperature. Spraying in the field area should be done in the evening, not before 5 pm (4 pm in winter) on a day that is not too windy or too hot, avoiding direct sunlight. A slightly overcast, late afternoon is ideal. Avoid spraying in the rain, or if heavy rains are forecasted after spraying. Don\u0027t spray if night frost is expected, in order to ensure the correct working of preparation 500.\n3. The main purpose of this technology is to sustain living soils, since application of \u2018Preparation 500\u2019 is intended to increase soil bacteria life, enhance the earthworm activity, promote rooting and greater absorption and retention of water.\n4. The flat tree orchard was already under organic farming management (since 1998) before the current technology was applied. In 2014 the farmer changed the agricultural management on his own initiative to biodynamic practice with the same crop. The major new activity was the elaboration of the preparation 500, that is sprayed out in the orchard after the weeds are cutted. Secondary activities focus on maintaining the preparation 500 during the rest of the year and on improving the soil by keeping a permanent vegetation cover and reducing the tillage.\n5. There were several benefits observed after this technology was applied: regarding the soil quality a strong humus layer was formed and organic matter increased. In general the soil structure improved. Another positive impact was the response against plagues: the establishment of this self-sustaining agro-ecosystem as a whole increases the biodiversity and the beneficial species in the orchard.\n6. The land user is satisfied with the results of this technology in his orchard because it opened him a new market sector - the biodynamic farm market. The fruit quality and the soil characteristics improved, soil organic matter, soil structure and response against plagues were enhanced. On the other hand, the land user mentioned as challenging factors the big amount of money to change the agricultural management to biodynamic farming and the great effort to get the Preparation 500 and the external organization certifications, which are expensive.\nCOMMENTS:\nOrganic farming was established in 1998.

Land degradation means loss  in the capacity of a given land to support growth of useful plants on a sustained basis (Singh,1994). It  results from many factors or\/and combination of factors which damage the soil, water and vegetation resources and restrict their use or production capacity. Considering its impact on food security and environment, it is being important in many corners of the world. The productivity of some lands has declined by 50% due to soil erosion, fertility decline  and desertification of the world. Like other countries, Bangladesh is not exception in facing threat of land degradation. Due to different types of land degradation, Bangladesh lost a substantial amount of production which in terms of hundreds of billion taka in every year (BARC, 1999). It is high time to be conscious to minimize the land degradation in Bangladesh, a small country with 1, 47,570 sq. km and about 140 million people. The ever-increasing growth rates (1.48%) caused a spurt in all round consumption level. To meet up the demand of the present and forthcoming generation it is essential to sustain soil fertility and increase crop  productivity.\nConsidering the presentation land degradation scenario of Bangladesh, the farmers of Manikgong have adopted the SLM technology named \u0027 balanced fertiliser use  to minimise  land degradation as well as increase crop productivity\u0027. The technology has been approached by DAE personnel under \u0022Farmers\u0027 advisory services program\u0022 in Manikgong district of Bangladesh. The balanced fertiliser recommendation has been made according to the suggestion of soil resource development institute. The SLM specialists have  compiled database regarding the technology from    Dhalla union of Singair upazila under Manikgong district. The technology included applying different types of fertiliser like compost, Urea( Nitrogen), TSP\n  ( phosphorus), MOP( potassium), Zypsum( sulphur),  Zinc Sulphate( zinc+ sulphur)  etc. Compost, Urea, TSP, MOP, Zypsum  and Zinc Sulphate   are applied at the rate of 5 ton, 265kg\/ha, 90kg\/ha, 145 kg\/ha, 100 kg\/ha and 8.5 kg respectively. The main purpose of the technology was to improve soil nutrient status by using balanced fertiliser along with organic farming. The technology provides multidimensional  advantages for the stakeholders. It prevents  nutrient mining decline,  improves soil physical ,chemical and biological conditions,increase water holding capacity of the soil, increase  crop productivity and  improve socio-economic conditions of the land users.

These biological agents are supplied commercially as soil amendments, and specific treatments vary according to cultivation type.\nPurpose of the Technology: The technology is applied as an effective agronomic measure for the increase of plants salt tolerance, the reduction of soil borne diseases that affect plant roots and increase of water and nutrients absorption. This technology prevents or mitigates soil degradation by improving the subsoil structure by causing plant root system expansion and increasing the ability of the plant to absorb nutrients and water. This effect can potentially decrease agricultural inputs (water and fertilizers) up to 40%. An additional benefit is the maintenance and increase of subsoil faunal diversity and the subsequent biodegradation. The improved soil structure leads to higher infiltration rates, mitigates salt accumulation in the root zone and combats soil salinity, one of the main soil degradation problems in the coastal zone. Finally, the application of the biological agent helps to keep the plants healthy thus leading to increased crop yield, and reduced production risk.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The implementation of such agents usually takes place once per plant as the microorganisms coexist with the plant (symbiotic association) and can be performed in different stages of the crop cultivation depending on the commercial product, e.g. as solution in the irrigation water, as solid soil amendment in the early growing stages, or optimally, to be applied in the plant nursery (seed bio-priming), or during planting (plant inoculation). Biological agents require increased organic matter in the soil, absence of toxic substances (e.g. copper, fungicides, and pesticides), and, depending on agent type, suitable soil moisture and temperature. Here we instigate the effects of biological agents in tomato plantations, which are implemented in the early growing stages through irrigation.\nNatural \/ human environment: The average annual precipitation in the area is 500 mm and the climate ranges between sub-humid Mediterranean and semi-arid. Average annual temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C with 6 months below 18 \u00b0C but above 5 \u00b0C, thus classifying the area as subtropical. In the location where the technology is applied, land is mostly privately owned and water rights can be public, cooperative or private. The financial means of the land user applying this technology are more or less on par with those of the rest of the community, although he has wider empirical and theoretical education and higher impact acquired though his involvement in the local agricultural association as agronomist.\nThis Technology was documented within the scope of FP7 RECARE Project, grant agreement no 603498.\nCOMMENTS:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.002 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The main problem in the region is the change in the groundwater quality, caused by the groundwater exploitation and and the subsequent seawater intrusion, resulting in soil salinisation through irrigation. The poor availability of non-saline water for irrigation results in increased production risk and agricultural inputs.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Reduced soil fertility and productivity, increase of soil salinity that affects productivity both short-term and long-term.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"","type_id":"","use_cases":"Production|crop production|plant health|optimization of resource use for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 906, 909, 916, 921, 918, 917, 920, 926","readiness_level":"7.

The agrarian reform carried out in 1991 had both positive and negative aspects. One of the positive aspects of the reform was the creation of equal starting conditions: every rural resident, whether employed or unemployed, infants or pensioners, doctors or teachers was entitled to receive the share of land and property. As a result of the reform, 510,000 families received land shares, and most farms today consist of a single family. The country is dominated by small-scale peasant farms, which cannot obtain large incomes. The main costs are associated with production, transportation, and marketing of agricultural products.\nIn addition, a lack of knowledge about land cultivation, growing suitable crops, and the small size of land plots have led to negative consequences such as decreased soil quality and fertility, erosion, and other problems. Centuries of accumulated agricultural experience show that continuous cultivation of almost any crop results in a significant decline in yields, erosion, contamination, and soil salinization.\nCrop rotation plays an important role in addressing the issue of maintaining soil fertility. To restore and improve soil fertility, a crop rotation system has been introduced at the farm level. This technology was implemented within the FAO\/GEF project \u201cSustainable Management of Mountain Forest and Land Resources under Climate Change Conditions.\u201d To facilitate its application, training seminars and workshops were held for farmers, and a demonstration plot was selected.\nThe demonstration plot is relatively small: 1 ha, divided into three almost equal sections of 0.3\u20130.4 ha each. These sections are used for the alternating cultivation of different crops and the performance of necessary agricultural activities. To restore the soil and ensure good harvests, it is important to follow a planting plan.\nCrop rotation plan\nCrop alternation by year\n      Plot        Year 1       Year 2     Year 3\n1  (0.3 ha)  Maize      Cabbage  Potato\n2  (0.4 ha)  Potato     Maize      Cabbage\n3  (0.3 ha)  Cabbage  Potato    Maize\nLand users noted that applying crop rotation has had a positive impact on farm income by providing additional products.

In irrigated zones, the lack of precipitation is compensated by artificial irrigation. However, rainfed farmland depends entirely on precipitation, which is distributed extremely unevenly throughout the year. Under such conditions, measures to improve crop water availability become increasingly important.\nIn global agriculture, one of the methods for conserving soil moisture is the use of hydrogels, which can retain water in amounts 300 to 1,000 times their own weight. Unlike most water-absorbing substances, hydrogels can gradually release the absorbed water and nutrients to plants. Thanks to these unique properties, the hydrogel functions as a water reservoir that maintains normal soil moisture. Although it cannot replace water, it enables the most efficient use of rainfall and existing soil moisture reserves.\nHydrogel is applied to the soil in dry form, evenly spread over the surface and then plowed in. In this case, the effect appears later, as the hydrogel needs to absorb water before it starts working. Once swollen, the hydrogel improves soil structure and its water-retention capacity. Hydrogel can also be applied after pre-hydration\u2014up to a 100-fold increase in polymer mass (about one hour)\u2014by spraying the mixture onto the soil. This method can be used immediately before plowing.\nThe use of hydrogels helps save irrigation water by reducing surface evaporation caused by the soil\u2019s inability to retain moisture.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe description of the technology is based on materials provided by Doctor of Agricultural Sciences D.

The area of irrigated land has increased more than twice in the last decades in the study areas.  In recent years, the considerable reduction of winter and autumn rainfall has caused a serious lack of water resources. The production of the various crops is substantially reduced if water is not provided during the summer period.\nThe high demands for water consumption or other economic activities have increased the price of water, forcing up the cost of agricultural production. In addition, in many cases, low quality (with high electrical conductivity) water is used for irrigation. The need for intensification of agriculture to meet the high cost of production, the use of poor quality of water, the lack of drainage systems are in many cases responsible for soil degradation resulting from water logging, salinization, alkalinization, and soil erosion.\nPurpose of the Technology: Drip or trickle irrigation achieves the highest irrigation efficiency since about 90% of the applied water is available to the plants. This SWC technology is especially suitable for watering trees or other large plants keeping strips among trees dry. Application of water by drip irrigation can be considered more as more efficient method using low quality of irrigation water. Irrigation water of high salt content can be applied in higher quantities in spots leaching salts to deeper soil layers. Drip irrigation can be applied in any type of soil from coarse- and fine-textured and without any limitation to slope gradient  requiring little labour during installation.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: In the study area of Chania trickle irrigation system includes mainly three branches from the outlet of main water network transportation system to the application in the trees. The last branch consists of plastic tube 12 to 32 mm in diameter that lies either on or just below the soil surface and applies the water either through small holes in the line or through emitter nozzle.\nNatural \/ human environment: In recent years the  increasing awareness of farmers on issues relating to the sustainability of the environment and conservation of water by promoting SWC technologies has led to widespread of use of drip irrigation in the area of Crete and in many other parts of the Country.

Here the technology is applied for different perennial and annual crops and with use of different sources of water.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Stefan MichelIn the arid areas of Sughd region cultivation of most crops is possible with irrigation only. In many cases conventional furrow irrigation is limited or impossible due to insufficient availability of irrigation water. Furthermore, conventional furrow irrigation is often connected with problems which make irrigated farming unsustainable \u2013 high water demand causes shortages for downstream water users and ecosystems, irrigation water can flush out nutrients from soil or cause erosion, high amounts of irrigation water and insufficient drainage can lead to waterlogging and where soil and\/or irrigation water contain high amounts of salt to salinization. From an economic perspective, the high amounts of irrigation water required for conventional irrigation can be costly, especially where pumping from sources to fields at higher elevation is required. Climate change impacts like increasing aridity, changing seasonality of rainfall, reduced storage of precipitation as snow and glacier ice and resulting irrigation water shortages during critical seasons require adaptation in irrigated agriculture. \nThe broader application of drip irrigation is one way to address economic and environmental issues of irrigated farming, while specifically addressing climate change impact. The major effect of drip irrigation is the increased irrigation water use efficiency \u2013 \u201cMore crop per drop\u201d. This avoids or reduces the above explained impacts of conventional furrow irrigation: water demand is massively reduced allowing irrigating fields and orchards in areas where water availability would not allow for conventional irrigated agriculture; loss of soil nutrients, irrigation induced erosion and waterlogging are avoided, salinization is much less likely and occurs only in small extent in cases where highly mineralized irrigation water is applied (not an issue in the described project region). The reduced need for irrigation water avoids conflict with downstream water users and the needs of ecosystems. Under climate change impact farmers applying drip irrigation have a higher security that sufficient irrigation water is available and the drip irrigation technology allows for an adapted provision of water to the crops in accordance to their physiological demand. Drip irrigation systems can be used to apply the accurate dosages of fertilizer directly to the plants. This increases the effectiveness of fertilizing and the efficiency in terms of costs as much less fertilizer is not taken by the crops.\nDrip irrigation is applied for various crops:\n\u2022perennial crops: orchards of apple, apricot, pear and other fruit trees, vineyards, lemons in greenhouses;\n\u2022corn, onions, potatoes; and\n\u2022honey melon and water melon.\nThe high initial investment influences on the economic profitability of the technology. The project demonstrated that drip irrigation can be used not only for orchards, where it has an advantage over field crops, because there is no need re-install pipes every season. But it can be used for crops such as melons, onion, sunflower and corn. In the case of honey melon and water melon drip irrigation is particularly efficient due to the large area covered by every single plant. Thus the distances between pipes and between drippers can be large to supply each plant, but the plants with their long tendrils and large leaves effectively use the space in between. In trials of onion cultivation the generally high investment needs, required density of tubes and drippers and the comparably low market price made the technology in not economically competitive under current circumstances. \nDrip irrigation can be applied with various sources of irrigation water. Compared to conventional furrow irrigation even low amounts of irrigation water or water from comparably costly sources can be effectively used. In the frame of the documented trials the following sources of irrigation water have been used for supplying drip irrigation systems in addition to water from irrigation canals:\n\u2022spring water collection with concrete reservoir;\n\u2022water from draw well, pumped to small water tower above the well and from their running by gravitation to concrete reservoir, from where it is supplying the drip irrigation system;\n\u2022rain water collection from house roofs with concrete reservoir;\n\u2022irrigation water withdrawn by large pumps from Syrdarya river and supplied via pipelines to newly irrigated areas;\n\u2022irrigation water from household water supply system, stored in concrete reservoir during day times of low demand.\nThe drip irrigation systems are equipped with manual (use of local irrigation water stored in concrete reservoirs or barrels) or automatic (direct use of irrigation water from pipelines) pressure regulation valves. At the outlets of reservoirs or at the pressure regulations device fertilizer can be added and provided to the plants in exact dosage.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|optimization of resource use for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|precision seeding and fertilization for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 909, 916, 920, 918, 921, 910, 914, 908","readiness_level":"9.

In order to stabilize the surface (i.e. to reduce the effects of freeze-thaw processes), to provide nutrients to the system, increase water availability and facilitate the spread of native species within the degraded areas, tractors are used to spread manure or hay over the denuded areas. All implementation is based on the methods and tools used in ecological restoration, aiming at re-activating environmental and ecological processes, and increasing the resilience of the ecosystems undergoing restoration. Denuded patches, preferably close to the remaining vegetation \u0022islands\u0022, are covered with organic matter in order to stabilize the surface, facilitate seed production and dispersal and provide safe sites for germination.\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of the technology is to halt further land degradation and facilitate natural succession within the area undergoing restoration. In the long-term, it should substantially reduce wind and water erosion. It should also lead to increased biodiversity, enhanced water availability and accelerated carbon sequestration (in both soil and vegetation). The overall restoration task is to increase the resilience of the ecosystems to natural hazards, including volcanic activity.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: In the year after the areas are addressed, they are commonly treated with a low level of inorganic fertilizer to provide readily available  nutrients to the seeds, and seedlings that have already germinated, within the area. The fertilizer treatment is repeated twice a year for 4-8 years on average.\nNatural \/ human environment: In the long-term, the technology is expected to substantially increase biomass production, re-build soil qualities, accelerate carbon sequestration and secure water availability within the rangeland and the adjacent ecosystems. The areas still grazed are assumed to be more suitable for grazing and the protected areas are expected to be of better recreational and aesthetic value. The increased vegetation cover will reduce, and even halt, the sand drift that still creates challenges for inhabitants in adjacent villages, on farmsteads and within the summerhouse clusters scattered around the area.

The major land use problem are related to the fact that the concerned ecosystems collapsed long time ago and despite all restoration efforts implemented within the area for over 100 years, the systems are still highly dysfunctional. Their carrying capacity is limited and even light livestock grazing can keep further vegetation succession down.

For the purpose of weed control the field is ploughed every third year. Also herbizides are used for weed control. The special drilling machine used for this provides the opportunity of regulating the density of sowing and the dosage of applied fertilizer in accordance to the yield potential of the site, which is typically determined by soils fertility and moisture.\nIn comparison with the traditional methods of arable farming the application of the zero tillage technology (direct drilling) reduces the following risks from the ecology and agronomy point of view: soil compaction, lump formation, destruction of the soil and dust formation, and manifestation of water and wind erosion. Also, the decrease of organic matter and the destruction of the habitat of soil organisms caused by intensive mechanical soil treatment are reduced. The avoiding of breaking up and turning the upper soil horizon hampers the evaporation from the soil surface and increases the soil moisture.\nFrom the economic perspective, with the use of zero tillage technology (direct sowing) farmers can save the expenses for ploughing, leveling, chiseling that significantly reduces the costs of farmers. Improved soil moisture reduces drought-related risks of rain-fed winter wheat farming. Despite the fact, that the season of 2017-2018 was unusually dry and cold, the direct drilling technology showed good result impressing local farmers.\nThe technology has been demonstrated at two demo plots (each 2.5 hectares) for cultivation of wheat crop, established in Devashtich district during the 2017 agriculture season. To ensure longer-term sustainability of the idea and quick dissemination among the farmers, the local Non-commercial cooperative \u201cAgra va iqlim\u201d was engaged as a local partner, which has been assisted in the purchase of a combined drilling and fertilizing machine (\u201c\u00d6zd\u00f6ken\u201d, Made in Turkey). Additionally wheat varieties have been provided, which are particularly suitable for rain-fed farming and can cope with due to climate change increasing aridity in the area: \u201cSultan\u201d (Turkey), \u201cSarvar\u201d (Tajikistan), \u201cKrasnodar99\u201d and \u201cMoskovskiy93\u201d (Russia). These varieties are high growing and provide a good amount of straw, which is in high demand by livestock owners in the region (1.7 TJS per kg). \nAs a result, during the agricultural season 2017\/2018 already 50 involved farmers applied the technology for 50 hectares of rain-fed land for winter wheat. During 2018\/2019 an expansion of involved farmers to approx. 150 and of the coverage area to 150 hectares of land for cultivation of winter wheat is planned.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Production|crop production|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|optimization of resource use for better production|improved plant varieties|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 908, 909, 902, 910, 914, 916, 918, 921, 920, 917, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

The surface accounts for about 0.46 ha. Long before the establishment of the orchard, land cover consisted of denuded or sparsely covered white wandering sand dunes threatening agricultural production and villages alike. For some years vegetable production took place on this piece of land and later the orchard was established. Fruits are aimed at sale on the local market but production is insufficient for commercial purposes due to a pest and senescence of fruit trees. Citrus fruits are used by the cultivator and his family for pharmaceutical purposes. Inorganic fertilizers and organic manure are both used in order to improve soil fertility. Irrigation with water from one of the 8-9 m deep wells is practiced for a few Cocos nucifera plants but not for the other species. Labor is done by employees with whom the assigned caretaker of the orchard shares the little revenues from selling fruits on the market. The orchard is protected by a hedge made of dead Balanites aegyptiaca and Acacia raddiana branches and contains a small number of living individuals of other species.\nNatural \/ human environment: The Niayes, located between Dakar and St. Louis, constitute a territory of 5-30 km width covering a surface of 4\u2019200 km2. The region profits from a cool, humid climate, caused by the northern maritime winds (aliz\u00e9s) during the the dry season, while the rest of Senegal experiences the dry and hot Harmattan winds from the East. This results in favorable conditions for vegetable production during the dry season. Sand dunes cover the entire territory being categorized as white or wandering dunes, yellow semi-fixed dunes and as a system of continental fixed red dunes. The continental sand dunes support a shrub savanna which has been used as grazing ground by Fulbe pastoralists for centuries. The near-surface groundwater is the key that allows for cultivation of the zone, however considering the decline in rainfall during the last 60 years, the future of this water source remains uncertain. Lack of rainfall was one of the causes that led to the retreat of natural vegetation which therefore was not sufficient to stabilize the dunes any longer. Migration of sand dunes could now attain up to 10-12 m a year. However, deforestation at the beginning of the 19th century as well as overgrazing were important factors causing gradual desertification in this system.\nCOMMENTS:\nMajor casch crop: Mango, lemon\nMajor food crop: Mango, lemon\nOther crops: Cocos\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): wind erosion\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|Access to markets|direct sale to consumers or businesses","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 917, 921, 920, 918, 928, 929","readiness_level":"9.

A. raddiana is a native trees species which is able to tolerate extreme droughts and to persist on the edge of the Sahara desert. Acacia plantations are set up following a 3m x 3m grid using seedlings of A. raddiana. Seedlings are planted in the bottom of infiltration pits which are constructed for rainwater harvesting. Protection of the plantation area is established by means of a fence.\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of afforestation is the rehabilitation of degraded drylands and restoration of the original forest-steppe ecosystem in the Bled Talah region, which suffered for over a century from overexploitation of natural resources and intensification of agricultural activities. Focus is put on the synergy between the protection of the natural resources with the involvement of local people and the improvement of their livelihoods.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The protection of the Bled Talah region was initiated in 1936 and from then on several actions were undertaken such as the construction of a tree nursery and the creation of Integral Protection Zones through complete fencing. The Bled Talah area was designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1977. Bou Hedma National Park was officially created by the Ministry of Forests in 1980 covering an area of approximately 16.000 ha.

There are two major types of area enclosures practised in Ethiopia: (1) the most common type involves closing of an area from livestock and people so that natural regeneration of the vegetation can take place; (2) the second option comprises closing off degraded land while simultaneously implementing additional measures such as planting of seedlings, mulching and establishing water harvesting structures to enhance and speed up the regeneration process. The focus of this case study is on this second type. \nThe selection of measures chosen for rehabilitation depends mainly on the land use type, and to a lesser extent on climate, topography and soil type. Degraded croplands with individual land use rights are normally treated with additional structural measures to retain soil moisture and trap sediment, and with agronomic measures to restore soil fertility. Open access grazing lands are closed for natural regeneration while partly treated with additional measures, and open access woodlands are simply closed. In the case study area 60% of the enclosed area is under treatment with additional conservation measures and 40% is under natural regeneration. First, the area to be closed is demarcated and protected with fencing, usually live fences, and a site guard may be assigned to further ensure protection. Structural measures such as micro-basins, trenches, and bunds that enhance water infiltration and soil moisture may be constructed to increase survival rate of vegetative material planted. Hillside terraces, spaced at a 1 m vertical interval with a width of 1 m are constructed on steep slopes (exceeding 20%). Nitrogen-fixing and multipurpose shrubs\/trees (for fodder, fuel) such as Acacia saligna, Sesbania sesban, Leucaena leucocephala as well as local grass species such as napier (Pennisetum purpureum) and rhodes (Chloris gayana) are planted as additional measures for conservation.\nThe maintenance of area enclosures involves activities such as replanting, maintaining of fences, pruning of trees and weeding. After one year, cut-and-carry of grass for stall-feeding can be partly practiced - which is of economic benefit to the farmers. Rehabilitation normally takes about 7-10 years depending on the level of degradation and intensity of management. Land use is limited to selective cutting of trees, collection of dead wood and cut-and-carry of grass for livestock fodder. On individually owned enclosures land users start cutting trees after three years (for eucalyptus) and after 7\u20138 years (for other trees), while on communal land farmers are allowed to collect dead wood after 3-\u20134 years, and the community decides about the use of trees.\nCOMMENTS:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 20 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Over 30% of the land in the study area is degraded, resulting in low crop yields and poor livestock production. Severe water erosion is the main cause of land degradation on all slopes, followed by fertility depletion due to intensive cultivation practices and overgrazing. Serious gully formation and a high sediment load in the Bilate River threaten Lake Abaya. Communal grazing lands, woodlands with open access, and cultivated lands on steep slopes without conservation measures are particularly affected. By tradition, land users in rural Ethiopia can own as many livestock as they wish, which encourages overstocking.\nRanching: (before SWC)\nOther grazingland: mixed silvo-pastoral (after SWC): cut-and-carry, trees\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|water use optimization for sustainability|Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|forestry management|crop production|Farm management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|field management","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 917, 918, 919, 920, 897, 899, 1186, 927, 898, 910, 915, 914","readiness_level":"7.

Because of over grazing and erosion impact, areas delineated for closure are usually degraded shrub or pasture lands that served for grazing. First of all, implementing area closure requires continuous dialogue and discussion with community to reach consensus to close. The community wants to make sure they have benefited from the technology as the land was serving for grazing. They should take the responsibility and create sense of ownership to implement conservation measures, protect and maintain closure areas, and regulate utilization of benefits gained out of it. Questions raised from the community must be discussed thoroughly ahead of the implementation. What part of the degraded land? For what purpose the area is closed? Who are the users? Who are responsible to protect and manage the developed resourcess? How is the benefit sharing among identified users? Commonly, the shared benefits from area closures are hay for livestock through cut-and-carry system, timbers from plantations, and honey production.\nDepending on the soil, rainfall and slope conditions different structural and vegetative measures are integrated to enhance the fast regeneration of plant species, restore the soil and increase water availability. It includes enrichment used to rehabilitate and increase the vegetation cover, vegetative and structural measures to retain the soil and water on its place. Structures such as hillside terrace often integrated with grass or shrub hedgerows is used to control soil erosion. In-situ water harvesting structures such as trenches or half moon or eye brow are used to harvest and infiltrate rain or runoff water to increase regeneration and survival of planted trees. Trees and\/or shrub species that have high rehabilitation and multipurpose values are used as enrichment plantations. Closed areas need collective action to protect, maintain and manage the common resources. Collective user rights have to be entitled to bring equity on resource sharing and minimize social conflicts.\nThe purposes of area closure are: 1) rehabilitate degraded lands, 2) protect and restore the natural resource base, and 3) change into productive land and enhance economic and environmental functions of rehabilitated lands.\nImplementation of area closure begins with the selection and demarcation of area through genuine participation of land users. After identifying the area to be closed, at establishment stage construction of ditches and terraces is made using stones combined with grasses or shrubs of multipurpose value such as Vetiver grass, Dinsho grass, Bana grass, susbania, etc. Depending on site conditions, enrichment tree species which have rehabilitation and soil restoration purposes are planted in the form of wood lot or scattered tree plantation. Among the common species, A. albida, A. saligna, A. decurrense,  Gravilia robusta, etc. are used to rehabilitate and serve as fuel wood and timber. In moisture stress areas structures like trench, level bunds, and half moon should be constructed to increase survival rate of planted tree\/shrub species whereas in areas having sufficient moisture these structures, depending on the landforms and soil drainage conditions, help to increase infiltration and recharging of ground water in downstream areas. Therefore, site selection and demarcation, construction of soil conservation and moisture conservation structures, and seedling management and plantation of multipurpose trees, shrubs and grasses are the activities accomplished at establishment stage of area closure. The required inputs are stones, seeds\/seedlings, grass cuttings\/splits, hand tools, and collective labor. For recurrent maintenance activities, seedlings and cuttings for re-plantation purpose or replace dead seedlings, stones to repair damage stone terraces and moisture conservation structures. Harvesting and transporting of area closure products such as grass and timber become a recurrent activity. Person days per hectare per year required for plantation (preparation of holes and planting) is 11.5, for harvesting and transporting harvested grass is 30, and for terrace construction is 26.5.\nArea closure management is commonly practiced on degraded hills where soil is highly depleted, its water holding capacity is low, and vegetation is denuded. Usually degraded lands are used to serve for communal grazing system. The degree of land degradation becomes severe where there are high livestock and human population pressure. Management of closure area and the benefit sharing has to be regulated using agreed bylaws.\nThe living condition depends on subsistence crop-livestock mixed farming. On average households have 5-6 family size. Crop production is meant for home consumption with small surplus for local market. The services related to water supply, energy supply, and infrastructure are low.

They are crucial in preventing, controlling, and restoring of Prosopis management and are preferred for their cost-effectiveness, offering significant financial, environmental, and social benefits. Enclosures improve land aesthetics, diversify income sources in pastoral economies\u2014such as through the sale of grass seeds and fodder\u2014and help reduce conflicts over grazing land. In Baringo, several women have reported improved livelihoods and livestock acquisition from income generated by selling grass products.\nThe implementation of this SLM technology involves several steps: Established Prosopis trees are manually cut and uprooted using simple tools like machetes and hoes, with roots removed about 30 cm below the soil surface to prevent coppicing. This labor-intensive process can be hindered by inefficient equipment, potentially increasing costs. Barriers are then erected around the cleared land to restrict access by livestock and unauthorized individuals, often using tree branches for fencing. A tractor plows and ridges the land to create ridges that enhance water infiltration, with stone bunds placed along the edges to slow water flow and reduce soil erosion. Grass seeds are sown on ridge risers to form grass strips, with sowing timed for the rainy season to ensure optimal germination. While the Ministry of Agriculture provides seeds, local farmers may also sell them, as supply can sometimes fall short of demand. Additionally, native plants like acacia are intercropped with grass to offer extra ground cover and shade, reducing soil water evaporation.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 1186, 910, 1180, 916, 917, 921, 914, 915, 918","readiness_level":"7.

Demarcation is done by planting trees in identified area situated about 300 meters from the riverine buffer zone. The preferred plants are Ficus thonigii. The average space between trees is 2 meters. Physical enclosure is supported and enhanced by use of protective bylaws.  Reseeding of nutritious pasture species is also done and the area is left under protection for growth and regeneration of mulch, pastures and other vegetation to take place. The common pasture species reseeded are Leucaena spp, cannavaria brazile, clitoria tenatea, sesbania sesban, stylothensis, cajanus cajan, chloris gayana, branchalia spps . Direct grazing is prohibited and mulch and pasture materials are accessed through controlled and organized cut and carry.\nArea enclosure is meant for rehabilitation of the riverine ecosystem and prevention of further degradation.

They are generally broad and shallow by design to move surface water across farms without causing soil erosion. The vegetative cover slows the water flow, minimizing channel surface erosion. When properly constructed, grassed waterways can safely transport large water flows down slope. These waterways can also be used as outlets for water released from contoured and terraced systems and from diverted channels. This practice reduces sedimentation of nearby water bodies and pollutants in runoff.\nPurpose of the Technology: In Embu District, waterways are constructed to act both as a channel of disposing run-off into the river and a foot path. The type of vegetation that is used in this district is fodder grass called paspalum. They are used on slopes of less than 20% and where flow velocities do not exceed 1.8 m\/s. They are also suitable in areas where rainfall intensities are high and excess run-off is frequent, such as slopes in humid regions, in semi-arid or arid regions where soil infiltration rates are low and run-off is concentrated, where cultivated fields have been treated with various types of terracing systems and drainage is necessary and on non-cultivated lands to connect run-off drainage structures such as diversions, cut-off ditches. Advantages of grassed waterways include flood damage prevention; erosion control; aesthetic value; water quality improvement; design based on landowner\u2019s\/farmer\u2019s experience; soluble contaminant flow retardation; and dispersion of concentrated flow, thereby minimizing gully erosion.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Limitations of this practice include the cost of installation (e.g., grading slopes and vegetation establishment), loss of acreage for pasture or crops and the variability of effectiveness due to the uncertainty of runoff rate and frequency. Disadvantages of a grassed waterway include working around it with farm equipment, vegetative growth may be troublesome and the depth of the waterway limits it as a tile drainage outlet. The construction of the waterway will depend on the soil\u2019s erosive potential. For example, a shallower waterway will result in an area with more erodible soil. Depending on the equipment and labor costs, grading, seed and fertilizer selected, the cost of establishing grassed waterways will vary. However in most cases where no additional structures are constructed on the waterway, grassed waterways are cheap to construct. Potential returns include fodder for feeding the farmers animals which is very common in Embu North District.\nCOMMENTS:\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soil erosion on water ways\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Soil erosion from the runoff\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|Production|animal production|crop production|disaster management|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 920, 910, 914, 897, 899, 898, 1154, 918","readiness_level":"9.

The PO are now vigilant because they already installed Artificial Reefs before but were destroyed by the dynamite fishers. This encouraged the PO members to practice safe and legal forms of fishing in order to sustain their project. Above all, artificial reef will enhance fish spawning and provide alternative shelter to fishes during  hot season.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe team decided to get the coordinates of the 2 ends and middle part of the Artificial Reef installed due to the weather and current of the tide.

The main objective of implementing Aserpiado is to let water infiltrate on-site, thereby increasing soil moisture and plant available water, decreasing runoff and associated losses of soil.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Wolfgang DuifhuizenAserpiado (also known as Alumbrado) is applied in vineyards in Southern Spain in lower and mid altitudes where the climate is characterized by relative high rainfall during winter, but almost none in summer. This requires adoptions in the water management like irrigation or on-site storage of water.\nWith the aserpiado technique, seasonal soil bunds are made every autumn in order to limit irrigation requirements and to protect the soil against erosion. These contour bunds in the allies remain in place the entire winter to make best use of precipitation that occurs mostly during this period. \nThe functioning of Aserpias was analysed in a vineyard within the Appellation of Origin Montilla-Moriles in C\u00f3rdoba, the only previously existing documentation on this measure comes from vineyards in the Jerez wine region. Farmers use Aserpiado because it is the only way to get enough water without irrigation, as when irrigation is applied it cannot get the protected \u2018Jerez-Sherry\u2019 label. \nThe microbasins are made in the inter-row area by dragging a caterpillar tractor pulled (see picture Aserpiadora) hydraulic beam over the field which lifts leaving a heap of soil behind. The speed and interval of the beam are set in such a way that a bund is made every 1.5 meter. Some users sow barely directly in advance of making the aserpiado which results in a high plant cover of the bunds during winter. The main function of Aserpiado is to catch rainwater which otherwise would be lost runoff. With Aserpiado the runoff is close to zero this means more water should become available for the crops. \nThe required inputs for creating and maintaining aserpias depends upon whether the bunds are permanent or seasonal. If permanent the ridges should be checked regulary and maintained by hand. When the aserpiado is only present during the winter season regular tillage in summer is necessary to keep the soil workable so the \u0027aserpiadora\u0027 (specialized tillage tool) can create the aserpias in autumn which are removed in spring to ease field traffic. With a modern-day Aserpiadora a farmer can create 3 to 5 ha of aserpias a day (Narvaez, 1980). The impacts of establishing aserpias are less soil erosion, less runoff and more water storage in the soil. Land users like Aserpiado as it is a very effective way to increase soil moisture and reduce soil erosion, when used in combination with cover crops the soil quality also improves over time.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe only previously existing documentation on Aserpias features vineyards of D.O. Jerez, but is also used elsewhere like in the D.O. of Montilla-Moriles data was compiled. Popularity of this measure is unknown as very little documentation exists.Aserpias are only used if vine rows are perpendicular to slope. Documentation exists also of Aserpias being used in olive orchards (Narvaez, 1980).\nBiodiversity was not analyzed.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|climate change adaptation|optimization of resource use for better production|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"916, 920, 921, 910, 914, 897, 898, 918, 909, 917","readiness_level":"7.

The preservation of forests is an important topic for socio-economic development. The National Plan for Reforestation defines the main lines of the national reforestation strategy and is the framework for the implementation of this technology.\nThe goal of this technology is to prepare plots where acorns should be sown or cork oak seedlings from plant nurseries planted. These test plots are guarded, maintained and watered to allow young plants to grow. Thus, cork oak regeneration ensures the continued existence and development of the forest. It conserves soil and water and fights against desertification. There are several benefits such as cork production, wood production, fodder production and better soil cover. Furthermore this technology positively impacts the socio-economic development of local populations, and services production (landscape, welfare and recreation) for urban populations.\nThe implementation of this technology needs the following activities: in general, good quality acorns and seedlings are required. Seedlings should come from the same region where they are planted and be certified by the authorities. An initial step in implementation is the clearing and shredding of small, woody plants. Soil preparation consists of 30 cm deep ploughing to loosen the topsoil, and to allow easier root growth. Then rows of pits are dug. Generally, it is crucial to apply correct plantation and seedling according to the season (winter), to ensure a depth of 50 cm in the planting hole, and to water copiously after planting to ensure a good contact between the soil and roots. A fence installed to protect areas from grazing is temporarily required until the trees are robust enough to cope with browsing cattle. The enclosure period usually lasts a minimum of 6 years.\nThe natural condition is semi-arid with precipitation ranging from 350 to 450 mm per year. The underlying geology consists of quartzite and sandstone, covered by marl. Soils are varied, but the main types are hydromorph and ferrous. Socially, the Sehoul forest is populated by poor farmers, strongly dependent on forest resources (fodder and firewood). The forest is owned by the government, but managed by local communities, who benefit from its use (marketing of cork, pharmaceutical products, charcoal, etc.). The rights of free forest exploitation for the local population are a political problem which needs to be resolved in order to achieve good forest management. Economically, the contribution of forestry to the GDP is low, but its environmental role is essential.\nCOMMENTS:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.2 km2.\nCork oak regeneration through assisted regeneration in order to ensure the continued existence of cork oak forests.

Encroachment by settlements and agriculture has been associated with illegal tree cutting, hunting, and collection of fuel wood, bamboo and cane and other forest products. These activities are encouraged by sawmills in the vicinity and unemployment. Due to reduced canopy coverage, the forest soils have been exposed degraded. In order to restore forest health, the Bangladesh Forest Department introduced Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) practice. The access for public recreation and education and research is allowed inside national park. However, the collection of fuel woods and non-timber forest product from national park area by the local communities is a common scenario here.\nANR aims to accelerate, rather than replace, natural succession processes by removing or reducing barriers to natural forest regeneration such as competition with weedy species and recurring disturbances (e.g., fuel wood collection, grazing, fire and wood harvesting). Compared to conventional reforestation methods, which involve planting tree seedlings, ANR offers the significant advantage avoiding costs associated with propagating, raising, and planting seedlings. ANR is most effectively utilized at the landscape level in restoring the forest protective functions, such as soil protection, and is most suitable for restoring areas where some level of natural succession is already in progress. ANR offers distinct advantages over other forest restoration methods but also has some limitations. ANR is much cheaper to implement and can be applied over larger areas than other restoration planting approaches, but may be less effective in enhancing floristic diversity at the initial stages. Some of ANR\u2019s disadvantages can be overcome by enrichment planting with desirable species. ANR aims to accelerate, rather than replace natural succession process by removing or reducing barriers to natural forest regeneration.\nSoil degradation of MKNP has been greatly reduced through practicing ANR and co-management. In MKNP co-management was established on 2009 engaging local communities. As a part of co-management activities, the Forest Department (FD) formed a Community Patrolling Group (CPG) with 35 members from the local community to protect the Garjan trees and look after the whole forest along with forester officers. Under the support from Climate-Resilient Ecosystems and Livelihoods (CREL) project of USAID, the CPG along with FD intensively patrol the forest in rotating groups to ensure that no harm is done to the mature trees and natural seedlings. As a result, sufficient tree regeneration is now taking place and their growth is accelerating. Even where weeds dominate, seedlings of pioneer tree species are often found. The minimum required number of preexisting seedlings to implement ANR depends on the acceptable length of time for the forest to be restored and site-specific conditions that influence the rate of forest recovery. As a general reference, a density range of 200\u2013800 seedlings\/ha (\u003E15 cm in height; counting clumps in 1 m2 as one seedling) has been suggested for ANR reforestation, and it has been estimated that at least 700 seedlings\/ha are needed during the early treatment period in order to achieve canopy closure within three years. Although the forest restored through ANR in MKNP will have lower commercial value in terms of timber, it will support greater biodiversity and more effectively provide for the subsistence needs of the local people compared to commercial plantations.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Institutional|Governance function|Partnerships|Public-private partnerships|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1116, 1129, 1135, 1117, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"916, 927, 917, 921, 918, 922","readiness_level":"7.

The recommended density on cropland is between 60 and 80 trees per hectare. ANR is carried out mainly on individual plots where monitoring and upkeep are easier.\nPurpose of the Technology: Tree roots and fallen leaves help to stabilise the soil and thereby reduce water erosion. Some tree species have a fertilising effect on the soil. Legume species (for example, Faidherbia albida) enrich the soil with nitrogen. Other species circulate nutrients from the subsoil into the topsoil thanks to leaf fall. The shade provided by trees lowers soil temperature and reduces the evapotranspiration and thus water stress of plants. They also act as a windbreak and provide protection against wind erosion.\nThe environmental effect of ANR depends to a large extent on tree density. The reintegration of trees and shrubs into any ecosystem has positive ecological effects and improves and protects the soil. The vegetation provides shelter and forage for animals and contributes to biodiversity. Trees have positive effects on crop yields, when they do not compete with the crops for water. They also provide products and byproducts, such as wood, fruits, leaves, forage, ingredients for medicinal products, etc. Faidherbia albida, for example, has no leaves in the rainy season, which is beneficial for crops. In the dry season, it is green and provides sheltered places for animals to rest. Leaves that fall from this type of tree fertilise the soil. The wood, leaves, pods and fruits provided by trees in crop fields help the owners to meet their family\u2019s needs during the lean season.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: In order to implement this technique, there must be a very clear legal framework governing land tenure.\nIn order to ensure the success of this measure, it is important to protect the tree seedlings and saplings from browsing animals during the first few years. The young trees are pruned regularly to stimulate growth, so that they quickly achieve the height required to make them safe from browsing animals. The choice of tree species depends on the intentions of the farmers (browse for animals, sale of fruits or byproducts such as shea butter, dawa-dawa, medicinal products, etc.). The technique requires no investment, apart from the work involved, and can be implemented by any land owner.\nNatural \/ human environment: The Sahel is a region where the population has always faced a high degree of climate variability, manifested both in terms of time (unexpected dry spells can occur during the rainy season) and in terms of space (rainfall can vary greatly from one area to another). The population is mainly composed of small farmers and livestock keepers.\nOver the last two decades, the effects of climate change have exacerbated the already difficult conditions. Accord\u00acing to projections made by climatologists, the Sahel will experience a rise in temperatures combined with highly variable rainfall and an increase in extreme weather events.\nThe Soil and Water conservation and rehabilitation techniques have helped people in the Sahel to manage their ecosystems more effectively and improve their productive land. As a result, communities are better prepared to cope with environmental changes (changes in the climate, land degradation, etc.) and the im\u00acpact of shocks, particularly droughts.\nCOMMENTS:\nAssisted Regeneration has been applied in farmers\u0027 fields in combination with stone bunds and planting holes (tassa).major cash crop: Ground nut\nmajor food crop: Millet\nother: Sorghum, cow pea and mangoes\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): water and wind erosion, fertility decline\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): increasing pressure on land, mostly small farmers, traditional land rights, fields are individually managed, grazing land are commons\nNomadism: Yes\nSemi-nomadism \/ pastoralism: Yes\nCut-and-carry\/ zero grazing: Yes\nImproved pasture: Yes\nOther grazingland: agropastoralism\nSelective felling of (semi-) natural forests: Yes\nForest products and services: timber, fuelwood, fruits and nuts, grazing \/ browsing, other forest products \/ uses (honey, medical, etc.)\nFuture (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Mixed: Mf: Agroforestry\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: farmers are mainly agropastoralists with some communities specialised on pure pastoralism\nConstraints of common grazing land\nConstraints of forested government-owned land or commons\nLivestock density: 1-10 LU \/km2\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Production|crop production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|forestry management|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 918, 921, 922, 897, 898, 899, 1186, 927, 910, 914, 909","readiness_level":"9.

Fence materials (iron posts and galvanic wire) are externally sponsored and locally assembled and installed. Along the fence a dense living hedge of thorny trees (local tree species: e.g. Acacia nilotica, A. senegal, Prosopis sp, Ziziphus mauritiana) is planted. A strip of 10 m along the hedge is dedicated to agriculture. This area is equivalent to approximately 10% of the protected area. The rest is dedicated to natural regeneration of the local forest. Once protected, natural vegetation rich in endogenous species can actively regenerate. Annual vegetation species inventories are made to monitor the biomass, biodiversity and the growth rate of the trees. The forest reaches a tree density of approximately 500 trees per hectare and consists of around 120 local species. Some enrichment planting of rare species enhances the allotments. The protected area is of paramount importance for biodiversity conservation. Management activities in the protected area includes (1) seeding \/ planting of improved fodder species; and (2) establishing stone lines and half-moons (demi-lunes) for soil erosion control and water harvesting, (3) installing bee hives for honey production; and (4) fodder production: the grass is cut, tied and carried to feed livestock outside the regeneration area. Property rights for the protected area are clearly established through a contractual agreement that includes\/respects traditional and government land rights.

It involves locating and preserving shoots from stumps of woody and herbaceous vegetation on communal land used for agro-pastoralism, sylvo-pastoralism or pastoralism. The aim is to accelerate the process of natural regeneration resulting from natural seedlings or from sprouting stumps inherently present in the area.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Soumaila AbdoulayeAssisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) is an agroforestry technique applied in areas affected by water and wind erosion on cropped fields as well as agro-pastoral and sylvo-pastoral land. Erosion results from (i) tree felling in fields and the clearing of seedlings, (ii) over-exploitation of land, and (iii) the process of desertification. Local populations in the pastoral zone of Niger include mainly transhumant livestock keepers and\/or pastoralists (Tuareg, Bororo Peulh, Arabs and Toubou) who derive their income from the use of natural resources. People in the Sahelo-Saharan region have developed local know-how about sustainable land management, notably the practice of assisted natural regeneration on land that is exclusively set aside for grazing.\nThe significant growth of the population is dramatically increasing pressure on natural resources. In combination with the impacts of climate change and desertification, the process of land degradation has accelerated, resulting in chronic deficits in food and forage throughout the country. Facing these multiple environmental and ecological challenges, the state and its development partners have been testing and refining the technology of ANR since the 1990s. Assisted Natural Regeneration involves accelerating the process of natural regeneration of vegetation resulting from natural seedlings or from stumps inherently present in the area. Shoots from tree stumps with living root systems grow faster than seedlings derived from seeds. In the agricultural zone, ANR is a technique suited to improved land clearing, which involves locating and preserving shoots from stumps of desirable species of woody and herbaceous vegetation during the process of opening of land for cultivation. In addition to the protection of the shoots, selected species can be planted or sown through \u2018enrichment planting\u2019. The sprouts to be protected in the fields are identified during weeding. Weak stems are pruned out and fertile conditions created for development of the plants. On sylvo-pastoral communal land this results in an increase of desirable vegetation species with the best potential for ANR. These include those with a strong ability to sprout from roots (Balanites aegyptiaca, Faidherbia albida, Bombax costatum, Cassia sieberiana, Crateva  adansonii, Detarium microcarpum, etc.) or those that can be propagated by layering (Guiera senegalensis, Combretum micranthum, Pterocarpus erinaceus, etc.).\nIn the pastoral zone the practice was developed by livestock keepers to optimize the length of the grazing period during transhumance. Techniques employed are tree trimming, selection of the livestock routes for transhumance to enhance ANR through the movement of animals, monitoring and protection of palatable species, seeding of local forage crops in areas with low vegetative cover, and protection of particular species that enhance the development of understory vegetation.\nAn increasing number of development projects are trying to develop local practices of ANR, especially in the northern part of the region of Tahoua and in the southern part of the region of Agadez. The main objectives of ANR are: (i) protection of cropland through erosion control (water and wind erosion), (ii) improvement of soil fertility, (iii) production of firewood or timber, (iv) production of forage for livestock, (v) reduction of evapotranspiration, and (vi) restoration and preservation of forage resources in the pastoral zone.\nThe following results are expected for the agricultural and agro-sylvo-pastoral zones: (i) a significant increase of woody biomass for energy provision, forage and timber, (ii) an increase in agricultural yields, and (iii) new sources of income enabling farmers to improve their living standards. Results expected for the pastoral zone include: (i) conservation and preservation of palatable vegetation species for livestock in the grazing areas, (ii) an increase in forage resources and woody biomass, and (iii) restoration of the vegetation cover on degraded pastoral land.\nANR requires labour and hand tools (hoes and machetes). The low costs of implementation and maintenance are the major advantage of this technology; these explain the ease of adoption and the broad dissemination among agro-pastoralists and livestock keepers. However, due to the lack of regular monitoring of achievements and the weak enforcement of laws that regulate the management of forest resources, the ecological and socio-economic impacts of ANR in Niger are limited, especially in the pastoral zone.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe technology is applied in the pastoral zones of the northern regions of Tillab\u00e9ri, Tahoua, Maradi and Zinder. It is also applied in the region of Diffa and in the south of the region of Agadez. In all the southern regions, the technology is applied in agricultural fields and on communal land in use for sylvo-pastoralim.\nANR has been implemented in several regions in Niger: Maradi, Dosso, Zinder and Tillab\u00e9ri. In the pastoral zone, ANR is particularly applied in the departments of Abalak, Abala and Belb\u00e9dji. These applications were performed by livestock keepers individually on communal land and by organisations of producers. In the departments of Belb\u00e9dji and Abalak, the population is supported by development projects and local NGOs.Main animal species and products:  The main animal species found in the pastoral zone are: cattle, dromedaries, sheep, goats and donkeys. In this zone, the implementation of ANR is part of the management framework for herds and forage resources. The mentioned animal species are also found in the agro-pastoral zone in the south, but with many more equine animals.\nIn the agro-pastoral zones, the technology is applied on land primarily used for the production of millet, sorghum, cowpea, and cash crops; it is applied on land in use for agro-sylvo-pastoralism, sylvo-pastoralism and agro-pastoralism. Several development projects combine ANR with the development of markets for wood and forage. In these areas, agriculture, livestock and the trade of agro-pastoral products (livestock, cereals) are the main activities of local populations.\nIn Niger ANR is applied both on an individual basis at the field level and on communal land with the participation of the entire local population. The technology can be implemented on all types of land. The objectives of ANR depend on the types of land to which it is applied.\nLivestock density: In the pastoral zone of the urban municipality of Abalak, the livestock density was estimated at 50 TLU\/km2 in 2016. This density is found in the northern parts of the regions of Tillab\u00e9ri, Maradi and Zinder, and in the south of the region of Agadez.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Native species utilization|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1201, 1206, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|forestry management|Farm management|income increase|field management","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 916, 917, 918, 919, 921, 927, 910, 1180, 914","readiness_level":"7.

However, it has been lost, but then because of the requirement, which its processing depends only on water flow and it will work as long as the water flow is available and no need much care that cause this technology is reintroduced (ACF, 2009). As such, this pumping equipment does not need a machine or fossil fuel and requires less labor. According to the above advantages, Mr. Hour Pros, a farmer  in Saob Krom village, Saob commune, Preaek Prasab district, Kratie province, is the first person who did the installation. Even though, the cost of installation is relatively high at USD 1,500 depending on the types of materials from which it is manufactured (he selected the high quality of the iron pipe connections), this pumping equipment is quite durable and can be used for up to 20-30 years, he said. Furthermore, it has no adverse impacts on the environment since there are no greenhouse gas emissions.\nThis ram pump was installed at Sre Ngeat dam, where there is a natural stream flowing throughout the whole year. As a part of the installation of the ram pump the farmer constructed a concrete dam across the stream with a water gate that can be opened. Additionally, a concrete base had to be built 1.5 meters lower than the water level in the dam in order to house the ram pump equipment. A 12-meter steel pipe which is 144 mm in diameter runs straight from the dam\u2019s water gate directly to the pumping equipment. From the pumping equipment, there is a 30 mm hose (the size of this outlet must be smaller than that of the inlet) that transfers the pumped water to the location where it is needed. This pump is operated by the air pressure that is created by the water flowing from the dam to the pipe of pump and uses the air pressure to pushes water through the small pipe to bring water to the place where it is utilized, which is around 600 meters away at an elevation of around 8 meters compared to the pumping equipment. This ram pump has a pumping capacity of around 1.5 cubic meters per hour and can operate for 24-hours a day, with the ability to pump up to a height of 20 meters. \nThe water that is supplied by the ram pump is stored in two big water tanks (each one with a capacity of 4.7 m3), which  can then be used for household consumption,  the raising of about 100 chickens, and for the open valve irrigation of 5 ha of agricultural land. Another advantage of this pump system is that it does not affect the water quantity or pollute the downstream flow due to the fact that this system only took about 20-30 % of the water from the dam; 70-80% of the water was able to flow downstream, and so this allocation of the water supply did not cause any dispute between upstream and downstream users.\nCOMMENTS:\nThis equipment was installed on the Sre Ngeat dam in Saob Krom village, Kratie province.Number of growing seasons per year: 1\nMango trees and vegetable cultivation such as long bean, cucumber, lettuce, water morning glory\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|equipment management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 916, 920, 910, 914, 909, 915, 913","readiness_level":"7.

The cover crop also conserves soil moisture during drought periods. Besides soil conservation, baby melon is used as source of food and income to the land user. It is a vegetable crop which looks like pumpkin with wide leave and scroll on the surface of the land and has the ability to prevent soil erosion from run-off. The crop is also commonly grown along streams where it protects the banks from erosion, provides manure through leaf-fall, and reduces the risk of flooding by increasing the evopo-transpiration from its wide leaves.\nTo establish this cover crop, farmers use seeds, which is locally conserved from previous fruiting or bought from agro-input shop. Seeds are sown directly into a pre-cultivated garden. Usually planting is at a spacing of two meters. Planting is usually done at the start of the rainy season. Weeding, as well as pest and disease management is done the way pumpkins are usually managed. Fruits are harvested at a relatively early stage (~2 months after planting). A more juvenile fruit is preferred to the more grown one for its nutritional value. \nThe benefit of the technology is first for food, income and also for protection of the soil from the effect of running water and rain drops. The farmer obtains nutritious food from the fruits of this plant. The plants also prevent soil erosion and take a very short time to mature. When the plant covers an area, it reduces weed growth, thus reducing the cost of weeding. One disadvantage of this technology is that the pumpkins do not have a popular market and have a very short shelf life. Fruits therefore, have to be sold immediately after harvesting. The market value of the crop is generally low.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|field management|Supply chain management|support to consumption and nutrition","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 921, 917, 918, 914, 939, 944","readiness_level":"7.

It is planned to ease management of rearing the fish and to minimize maintenance costs. The system is also designed to harvest rain water and overflow which eases filling and emptying of the pond with water. The walls of the ponds are lined with tarpaulin and the banks are strengthened with timber or brick work to prevent breaking of the walls. The three ponds in Bushenyi-Kigoma are located on a gentle slope and designed with a trench that feeds them with rain water from the rain harvest reservoir up slope. They were constructed in 2013 and are located a meter away from a live fence enclosing the farmer\u2019s house. This makes it easy for the farmer to access, monitor and manage the fish ponds. \nThe establishment process for each pond is simple and may not require technical skills to set up the system. The activities involved include:\ni.Excavation of the pond, which is best done during the dry season to avoid interruption by runoff.\nii.Strengthening of banks using timber and nails (some farmers use brinks, cement and sand)\niii.Lining of the water proof tarpaulin on the interior of the pond.\niv.Construction of a water channel from the water reservoir to the pond and fixing of overflow pipes at the deeper end of the ponds.\nv.Filling the pond with water and applying animal dug to fertilize the ponds. This creates a favorable environment for growth of microorganisms and algae on which fish can feed.\nvi.The fish fingerlings are introduced into the pond two weeks after fertilization with animal dug.\nThe maintenance activities include; cleaning of ponds from contamination of objects, changing of the pond water on a monthly basis to avoid contamination that may lead to infestation and application of organic fertilizers.\nEstablishment requires a hoe, panga, dibber, spade, wheel barrow, hammer and the trowel. The inputs include; timber, tarpaulin, cement, garters bricks, sand, nails, plastic pipe, water, animal dung, fish pellets and fish fingerlings. These where used to construct a pond 5 m \u00d7 4 m \u00d7 3 m i.e length \u00d7 width \u00d7 depth respectively, with a maximum carrying capacity of 500 cat fish.\nThe costs of setting up the system are relatively affordable to the average local people according to the farmer. The key determinants are hiring labor to excavate the ponds, construction of a water channel and stocking fish fingerlings which are all locally available. The maintenance activities involve daily feeding of fish, cleaning in case of contamination, changing the pond water every 3 months and harvesting of fish at 7 months of age. The farmer spends USD $ 164.65 on establishment of the pond system including, exaction costs, equipment, materials and stocking fingerlings (USD $ 0.033 each). The farmer spends USD$ 21.99 on premixed feeds before harvesting the fish after seven months. The cat fish are harvested with 3-5 kg liveweight after 7 months and sold at USD$ 2.75 to wholesale buyers from Kasese District. \nThe intensive fish farming system is designed to demand minimal labor for feeding the fish, cleaning the pond, replacing water and harvesting fish. The system is also adapted to water scarcity in the dry season since it is connected to a rain water harvest system; regular changing of pond water improves visibility, removes algae, replenishes oxygen and minimizes possible infections in the pond.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe farm is 6Km from Ishaka Bushenyi along Bushenyi-Rubirizi highway.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Flood mitigation strategies|Traditional and indigenous practices|Frugal innovation|Social and socio-economic","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1203, 1204, 1206, 1088, 1076","use_cases":"Production|fisheries products management|Farm management|field management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"897, 900, 910, 914, 1180, 916, 920, 915","readiness_level":"7.

Owing to increased demand for more hives and due to extensive destruction of suitable trees, farmers now use locally available bamboo stems for making bee hives. This technology, apart from being a response to decreasing availability of materials such as large tree trunks that were previously used to make bee hives, it is also meant to provide a cheaper alternative to expensive modern bee hives such as the top-bar and Langstroth.\nBamboo canes are peeled into sheets of approximately 2-3 meters, and weaved in a manner similar to the way the baskets are made but in a cylindrical shape. The hives are constructed with a length varying from 0.5-0.8 m, and 0.4 m in diameter. The resulting open-ended cylinder is then covered with a grass layer of about 2 cm thick and wrapped with polythene strings to keep the grass in place. The grass is meant to insulate the hive against heat. The open ends of the cylinder are closed using a wooded circular piece of wood punched with about 10 holes of 1 cm diameter. It is through these holes that bees enter the hive. The completed hives are hung into a tree, where the bees colonize and produce honey. The hive should face north or south to protect it from the direction of sun and rain. The sun heat melts the honey comb from which honey is extracted. \nThe apiary should be free from termites, birds, and hygiene should be fully maintained. The hives may also be hung on two poles attached by wires that are used to hang them. These poles should be greased to avoid being damaged by termites, bush fire and red ants. The apiary should be 30 m away from the main road, flowering plants and also near water source within 100 m is recommended.\nAn apiary with bamboo-woven been hives conserves the natural environment and honey extracted from the honey comb generates income to the farmer. Shades must be provided at the apiary site during dry seasons. To protect the apiary, scouting should be frequently done. Bees are harmful and the apiary occupies land from other activities like agriculture.\nFarmers like this type of hive because it produces relatively clean honey compared to other systems. Furthermore, the bamboo hives last relatively longer because they are affected less by degrading insects. The low cost compared to other hives such as the top-bar or langstroth make it preferred by the bee farmers. However, there is also a high risk of fire since the hive is fitted with grass that could catch fire.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Frugal innovation|Social and socio-economic|Policy|Inclusion and Equity-Oriented Policies|Appropriate technology promotion","type_id":"993, 1188, 1088, 1076, 1095, 1136, 1111","use_cases":"Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"910, 1180, 916, 917","readiness_level":"7.

It serves for own consumption and for selling to generate regular household income. Its leaves are wanted on the market as well and can therefore generate good income too. Besides its low maintenance cost and easy to grow, banana can retain soil moisture and complement with ecology and biodiversity, on condition that its cultivation sustainable. Currently, the banana consumption in the region is increasing and results in banana expansion in the upland areas of Lao PDR. By tradition during the first year of banana plantation the local land users of Samouy district, Saravan province, Lao PDR cultivated banana intercropped with other upland crops (potentially with upland rice and maize) . However, the farmers implemented this cultivation technique without exact planning, measurement, in unorganized rows, or inadequate size of the hole. Also the poor maintenance after planting led to low banana productivity. In 2010, a Project supported by IFAD encouraged local people to grow banana with provision of technical advice through training and implementation. Banana plantation method recommended by the Project is following:1. Site selection: the land area with slope between 10-20 percent and rich loamy soils.2. Spacing and digging of holes: farmers arrange banana plants in lines and rows with spacing of 3m x 3m. 3. Dimension of hole: 25cm x 25cm with a depth of 30cm.3.Soil amendments: If the fertility of soil is low, manure (3 \u2013 5kg\/hole) has to be added on the bottom of the holes.4. Intercrops during first year of planation: Between the banana\u2019s rows upland crops can be seeded in regular rows. This helps to prevent soil erosion during the first year.5. Maintenance: Regular thinning and cutting of the banana branches are required after planting to get good yield. Thinning may also involve removal of excess banana suckers if there are more than 3-4 shoots per hole.6. Farmers are required to maintain banana plantation areas including regular weeding as well as soil amendment (animal manure) to promote successful banana production. Covering the soil constantly with banana leaves is one of the most important activities to maintain the soil\u2019s fertility (prevent soil leaching), structure and moisture, to improve the soil life, to lessen the burden of weeding and to prevent soil erosion. Chemical pesticides and fungicides are not foreseen to be used in this practice.7. After harvest of the intercrops: After the first year, when the maize or upland rice has been harvested, banana suckers will be planted in the rows on the remaining space between the one year old banana trees.In summary, this method of banana planting in sloping areas is simple and with average of 3-4 million Kip per household per year it generates good and regular income for the households. Banana provides fruits all year round that can be sold throughout the year whilst demand is also increasing. Currently, the average of the banana plantation area is approximately 10 ha per household. In addition, banana is tolerant to drought. Banana leaves spread over the soil (mulching) keep the soil moist provide best nutrients for soil organisms. And supplement amendment in form of animal manure improves the nutrient recharge. The soil cover improved to some extent from the beginning by the improved intercrop method according to the criteria learned by the project. However, the workload increased due to improved maintenance of banana.\nCOMMENTS:\nMain crops (cash and food crops): Banana as perennial (noon-woody crop \/ upland rice and maize at first year of banana cultivation.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Integrated management systems","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1203, 1206, 1197","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 914, 916, 921, 917, 918, 926","readiness_level":"7.

This reduces the labor required  for waste management at the Kraal while maintainig soil fertility.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Aine AmonThe Kraal (livestock zero grazing shed) was initially designed with a waste management system to hold cow dug in a reservoir for 1 to 2 months before being used in a 2-acre garden as manure. However, the farmer faced challenges transporting and distributing manure to the garden which was tedious and time wasting.\nThe dung from 4 cows is first mixed with water at a ratio of 1 (dung): 3 (water) as it drains into the reservoir producing approximately 1,500 litres of liquid manure monthly. Therefore, a pipe outlet was devised at the base of the cow dung reservoir to transport the waste 50m down-slope into 3 other reservoirs (each 2\u00d71\u00d71m, l\u00d7w\u00d7h) evenly distributed within the garden. These reservoirs store the liquid manure until the farmer wishes to fertilize the garden. \nThe garden preparation starts with clearing the weeds and then excavating small trenches that direct the flow of the liquid manure to any direction of interest in the garden. At different points along the flow in the trenches, the farmer opens tributaries leading to pits dug at least 0.75 m away from the banana plantains of interest. The pits made are normally approximately of 12.5 litres capacity. The trenches, tributaries and pits are then covered with soil after a day. This integrated fertilizer-irrigation system can only be possible on farms established on a gently sloping terrain. To set up the system one must have an animal house or any other source of animal dung uphill. The source must be able to provide enough dung to sustain the gardens established downhill.\nAlternatively, the system can also be set up with a biogas plant replacing the cow dung reservoir to produce biogas for domestic energy supply and the slurry being used as manure. In case of such modification, the biogas should be set up at a slightly elevated position to give the liquid digestate a gravity force to flow to the garden.  A foundation is excavated and a mixing chamber (50 litres capacity) constructed at some distance away from the farm house as well as 3 reservoirs to store the digestate (of a capacity at least 400 litres each) sited in the garden. An outlet pipe is fixed at the bottom of the mixing chamber through which the slurry can be channelled into the garden after the fermentation process producing biogas has stopped. \nThe construction process of the system without the biogas plant cost the farmer labour worth USD $ 13.44, construction materials were USD $ 251.04 and equipment USD $ 32.25. According to the farmer, the system is averagely expensive in the short run but profitable in the long run. \nThe system eases waste management and reduces costs of labour. The farmer, over the last 3 seasons realized improvement in the number of banana bunches harvested from averagely 50 to 60 bunches per month. The bunch weight also increased from 8-15Kg to 10-25Kg on average which is important for food security and livelihood.\nThe impacts of drought on the plantation have reduced compared to the time before adopting the technology. The farmer recommends upscaling since it is easy to manage, it improves productivity and is environment friendly. The major challenge is lack of enough cow dung supply from the kraal and scarcity of water in the dry season. A rainwater harvest system may be constructed to collect and provide water for diluting the cowdung.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1203, 1197, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|water use optimization for sustainability|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 921, 909, 920, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

One kilogram of barley seeds can yield up to 6 to 6.5 kg of green feed.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Sarah BabiryeBarley is a cereal grain that grows with hydroponic system to supplement on the feeds for livestock. This system enables crops to grow without soil so easily yet they mature within the shortest time in a smaller area. It is commonly used in finishing rations for livestock. Barley sprouts the best, grows the fastest and is cost-effective. This green feed is less expensive yet highly palatable and nutritious for animals.\nTo work well for sprouted fodder, the barley seed needs a high germination rate. Sprouting barley consistently and economically needs a climate-controlled space, light (18 hours of light and 6 hours of darkness) and a watering system. The ideal  temperature being 75 degrees F and 70% humidity. Air movement is necessary to control mold.\nThe technology ensures a reduction of pesticides and herbicides because the plants are in a protected environment . The sprouts are high in protein and fiber, and are naturally balanced in protein, fat and energy. Barley fodder has 95% of the energy and higher digestibility hence reducing the occurrence of digestive diseases, such as bloat. It is one of the most nutritious sprouts and is full of essential nutrients, vitamins and minerals. These are absorbed more efficiently due to the lack of enzyme inhibitors in sprouted grain. Dry barley seeds yields between 6-6.5kg of green feed. Feeding barley fodder will improve the overall health and wellbeing of animals. With this technology, farmers can easily anticipate the expected amount of feeds. Despite the benefits, growing barley requires skills, knowledge and constant supervision especially maintaining the conditions required. Barley seeds are at times hard to get. In case of commercial\/large livestock farming, the technology is not economically feasible. Bacterial and fungal growth is also another challenge like the common bread mould therefore seeds must be sterilized. The steps taken to grow barley seeds are as follows:\n\u2022On day 1, the barley seeds are laid on plastic trays after being soaked in water for 8-12 hours or an overnight. These seeds must be moist and kept clean. In case of any moulds, hydrogen peroxide may be used in the soaking water to kill mould.\n\u2022On day 2, the trays are placed on shelves where they are stacked. On this day, initial sprouting begins. Seeds must be kept moist, but not water-logged. Manually, water should be spread every after 4-5 hours. The seeds will usually sprout within 24 hours.\n\u2022On the third day, initial shooting begins. Watering still proceeds.\n\u2022From the 4-5th day, the root mat or the mat stem begin to grow.\n\u2022On the 6-7 the day, the farmers begins to harvest the barley grass and gives to the livestock. The grass has produced a 6-8 inch high grass mat with a 2 inch mat of interwoven roots.\nThe sprouted grain is harvested by removing the tray or sliding the mat off the tray in one long sheet. The mats can be cut to the appropriate size and fed to animals. Livestock will eat the whole thing like seeds, roots, and grass therefore, there is minimal waste. Barley is a major feeding option when pastureland and\/or hay are in short supply, or adds a highly nutritious and relished supplement to traditional grazing.\nInitial costs involved to a small scale farmer are minimal. This includes buying clean seeds, 5 kg costing 15,000\/=, 10 plastic trays (50000), 2 watering cans (20000), 1 bucket for soaking seeds (10000), watering seeds 6 times (18000), soaking seeds (3000), labour for making shelves (30000), papyrus mat (20000) ,2 kg of nails (10000), timber for making shelves (50000), chopping ready folder (3000) totalling to 232,000\/= for a start. However, this depends on the amount of fodder a farmer wants to produce. \nA kg of barley seeds yields to 7-10 kg of green fodder. Each kg of fodder is sold at 1500 hence in a kg planted (i.e. 3000 invested), a farmer is likely to earn  15000\/=\nThe technology is advantageous in that there is little or insignificant costs involved on maintenance of the technology. Maintenance only involves daily watering of seeds (18000 for 6 days), cleaning the treys after use (3000)  and supervision on barley during growing for 6 days (18000) totaling to 39000\/=.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"","type_id":"","use_cases":"","use_cases_id":"","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Uganda","country_origin_od":"494","region":"Africa","region_id":"102","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"100","id":"34084","title":"Barreiras Vivas de Leucaena","short_description":"Vegetative measure based on the planting of the bush, Leucaena leucocephala, on line along the level curves in the steep slopes\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Jacques TavaresThe technique consists of planting rows of Leucaena leucocephala in the level curves along the slopes.

Planting is done in a simple way of transplanting a plant nursery to the ground. It is easy to spread a culture, its management after the fruit must be rigorous, ensuring that the fields become invasive. The early harvest fruit is an option to take into consideration when implementing this technique. The bar between the plant is 1m and the distance between the bands is associated with 5m.Sometimes it is  ssociated with olds small punch to rehabilitating that structure.\nNatural \/ human environment: The top of the slopes where they practice pluvial agriculture is more susceptible to soil erosion because of its steep slopes and the inappropriate cultivation techniques carried out there, is the area of higher prevalence of this technique.

The compost is concentrated organic matter made from a mixture of dry grass, green matter and, if possible, a little animal dung. The best land for cassava is close to homesteads and away from livestock. This technology maximizes cassava production per plant. It improves soil fertility and helps restore degraded soils. Planting holes should be 40 cm deep and 60 cm x  60 cm wide. Each hole should be spaced 1 m apart. Basket compost is prepared as follows:\n- fill half the hole with dry organic matter, then pack it tightly;\n- add a layer of chopped-up green matter; the smaller it is chopped, the faster it decomposes;\n- add a 10 cm thick layer of fertilizer mixed with fertile soil;\n- cover with the top layer of original soil to form a mound;\n- mark the centre of the hole with a rod and place a heap of fertilizer and fertile soil before planting a cassava stem cutting;\n- leave the hole for 45 days;\n- plant the cassava stem cutting vertically in the place of the original stem, pushing 3 buds of the cutting into the soil;\n- compact the soil around the stem cutting. \nThe cassava stem cutting to be planted must be in good health, free from disease, especially mosaic. It should be mature, neither too young nor too old, leafless, with 4 to 5 buds, and at least 20 cm long. When the cassava plant reaches 30 cm in height, select the best stem (main stem) and eliminate the other stems (secondary stems).\nThe main inputs required to set up basket compost are :\n- dry organic matter: rice straw, weeds, other waste;\n- green plant matter: acacia leaves, banana leaves, green grasses, etc;\n- fertile soil mixed with animal droppings (manure). \nBasket composting maximizes tuber production; the yield achieved is from 5 kg to 25 kg of cassava per plant. The challenges associated with this technology lie in the harvesting process, transportation, and the procurement of organic materials (plant matter and animal manure). Although labour-intensive, this technology leads to high productivity within a limited area, making it well suited to small-scale farmers.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 909, 910, 914, 912","readiness_level":"7.

Farmyard manure has a high proportion of organic material which nurtures soil organisms and is essential in maintaining an active soil life. Only about half of the nutrient content of farmyard manure becomes available for crop growth during the first year after it has been applied to the soil - the rest is channeled through soil biotic processes and the nutrients are released in the following years. The high organic matter content and the active soil life improve or maintain friable soil structures, increase the cation exchange capacity, water holding capacity, and infiltration rate, and reducing the risk of soil pests building up.\n Indigenous methods of preparing and using farmyard manure vary widely depending on the ecological zone, access to bedding material from crop or forest land, access to crop residues and fodder, labour availability, and other factors. A prerequisite for the manure having a positive impact on soil fertility is that it is properly decomposed. The application of partially decomposed manure can increase the number of white grubs, red ants and other soil pests.\n Decomposition is enhanced and the time it takes to happen is reduced if the manure is kept warm and moist (but not wet) at all times. Heaping the manure up or storing it in a pit helps. Whether it is best to heap up the manure or put it in a pit depends on the local climate. Heaping has the advantage of being less costly, while the pit method reduces runoff and the loss of nutrient rich fluids. Adding nitrogen in the form of urine (N) improves the carbon to nitrogen ratio.\nCOMMENTS:\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Intensifying cultivation practices with either 1) inadequate application of fertilisers leading to a decline in soil fertility and the mining of soil nutrients or 2) application of too much fertiliser causing environmental problems through excessive leaching, and losses of fertiliser in surface runoff and consequent eutrophication or nitrification of streams, ponds or groundwater.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Production|crop production|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 922, 897, 898, 909","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Nepal","country_origin_od":"418","region":"Asia","region_id":"103","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"107","id":"34133","title":"Billons cloisonn\u00e9s","short_description":"La technologie de billons cloisonn\u00e9s est une pratique de fermeture des sillons aux extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s et\/ou par endroit pour la r\u00e9tention de l\u0027eau de pluie entre les billons.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Unknown UserLe cloisonnement s\u0027op\u00e8re de deux fa\u00e7ons.

A study was carried out in Prachinburi Province, Thailand, where there are chemical and physical degradation problems on the land. The area is lowland, with very sandy soil. The soil structure is poor and drainage is very slow. The organic matter and plant nutrient contents and soil fertility are low. Rice is grown but it gives very low yields. Farmers have changed their rice \ufb01elds to orchards and grow fruit and other edible crops such as durian, banana, lemon, vegetables (including Acacia pennata \u2013 Cha-om). They developed the land by digging ditches to make 1m-wide beds for growing crops and 0.8m-wide x 0.8m-deep drainage ditches. Farmers apply high rates of chemicals for both pest\/weed control and fertilizers, continuously. This is the main reason why farmers find the productivity of their land decreasing, caused by chemical soil degradation, and their farm investment has become unprofitable. \nOrganic agriculture has been found to be their solution. Farmers have learnt to develop their own bio-fermentation technology to produce organic fertilizers for soil improvement. There are three types of biological fermentation: (1) production of bio-fermented solution from discarded \ufb01sh by-products by using microbial activators, (2) production of photosynthetic microorganisms, and (3) production of bio-fermented water from rice \ufb02our water. They use the three types of bio-fermentation products to improve the soil by mixing at a rate of 1:1:1 per 200 L of water and applying to the soil during the \ufb01rst 3 years of fruit-tree planting. The use of bio-fermentation  to improve the soil involves a number of important activities: one is the process to produce bio-fermented solutions and the other is how to apply such solutions. \nThe impacts of the technology that the farmers have found are that it makes the soil more fertile, and organic matter and microorganisms in the soil (incl. earthworms) increase. The bene\ufb01ts from nutrients in the soil increase, as durian saplings can be grown which can be sold at a high price (e.g. 180 THB\/sapling). The cost of the technology is low because the farm\u2019s waste materials are used. The farmers\u2019 income increases; farmers enjoy better life with no debts \u2013 they are self-reliant as they are using environmentally friendly technology. There are reasons why farmers like this technology. This technology comprises the knowledge derived from experiential\/ practical experiments in the area of farmer-prototype technology users who can see the real results from using it. The methods\/procedures are not complicated; it is therefore easy to use. The technology is available through many channels, so farmers can access it easily. But there are some reasons why farmers still do not agree with this technology, i.e. there have been no technical documents with analytical data of plant nutrients or other e\ufb00ective ingredients to support it. Other farmers generally lack the motivation to adopt the technology.\nCOMMENTS:\n-\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Biologicals|Biotechnologies|Biofertilizers and biopesticides|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation|Grassroots innovation networks","type_id":"993, 2100, 994, 1001, 1196, 1206, 1076, 1088, 1090","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 910, 1180, 917, 915","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Thailand","country_origin_od":"483","region":"Asia","region_id":"103","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"110","id":"34136","title":"Biochar application as a soil amendment","short_description":"Application of fine-grained charcoal as an amendment to improve the soil quality and mitigate GHG emissions from croplands\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Nicola Dal FerroBiochar is a fine-grained charcoal, rich in refractory organic carbon compounds. Biochar is produced from pyrolysis of plant and waste feedstock, i.e. during thermal decomposition of biomass in partial or total absence of oxygen. As a soil amendment, biochar can favour a long-term stabilisation of carbon stocks, serving as a net withdrawal of atmospheric carbon dioxide. From an agronomic point of view, high organic carbon input from biochar can enhance the nutrient and water retention capacity of the amended soil, reducing the total fertilizer requirements.\nPurpose of the Technology: Therefore, the application of biochar is proposed as a strategy to reduce the climate and environmental impact of cropland systems as well as improve the soil quality by enhancing its physical-chemical characteristics.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Due to high recalcitrance of its C compounds, fine-grained biochar can be applied occasionally in the field, although its long-term effect is still being studied. High doses of biochar can be distributed (e.g. \u003E 10 t C ha-1) just before ploughing in order to favour its incorporation, mixing and interaction with soil particles.\nNatural \/ human environment: Potentially, the high stability of biochar C-compounds favours a reduction of GHG emissions by increasing the soil carbon stocks. Potentially, the soil can benefit from biochar application by improving its structure, the water retention capacity and finally the nutrient cycling. Nevertheless, it must be underlined that such technique is still in its infancy and needs testing before it is widespread as an agricultural practice. Although the biochar costs of production are not available, it must be noted that, due to the occasional application, the management costs would be low.\nCOMMENTS:\nThis is only a research trial that is now performed at the experimental farm of the University of Padova.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soils in the low Venetian plain of the Veneto region generally suffer from a loss of soil organic matter (SOM) that is strongly affected by their natural texture and climatic conditions. Moreover, in the last 50 years intensive tillage practices contributed to a further SOM decrease estimated at 0.02-0.58 t\/ha\/y of carbon and high intensive monoculture practices implied oversimplification of agro-ecosystems and decline of soil biodiversity.

The biochar is used as an amendment to farmland for ameliorating soil properties. Owing to the great number of micropores and charges on biochar, its application to soil boosts water and nutrient storage, and their delivery to crops. Biochar also helps neutralise acidity in soils, replacing the need for lime. All these positive e\ufb00ects make it ideally suited for acid, nutrient-poor soils in tropical\/ sub-tropical regions. Even at low rates of 1 or 2 tonnes per hectare, biochar signi\ufb01cantly increases crop production. Biochar hardly decomposes in soils, causing positive e\ufb00ects to last for several years without repeat application. This also provides very stable carbon storage on farms which helps mitigate climate change. Its stability also allows farmers to gradually add biochar to the entire farm, thereby increasing their food self-sufficiency and incomes.\nBiochar itself is not a fertilizer, but a soil rejuvenating agent. Therefore, farmers must apply essential nutrients through synthetic or organic inputs to reap the full yield potential and maintain soil fertility. Yet, when biochar is combined with fertilizers, about 40% - 70% nitrogen and phosphorus can be saved over multiple seasons while maintaining the same productivity. Biochar is a promising solution to address low response of crops to fertilizer addition in tropical soils and to alleviate the impact of input price hikes and supply disruptions.\nIn the study presented here, farmers produced biochar as a residue from small gasi\ufb01er stoves during daily cooking. These systems are highly energy efficient and reduce the consumption of firewood while improving indoor air quality, which, alongside crop yield gains from biochar, is perceived positively by farmers. The specific design of gasi\ufb01er stoves requires them to be well-packed with appropriately sized tree prunings or maize stems. For larger meals it requires a refill, which users find less convenient than their traditional open combustion \ufb01res. Life-cycle assessment shows that households significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the gasi\ufb01er stoves when biochar is applied to the farm. For the field trials with maize and kale in this study, farmers applied their usual rates of inorganic fertilizers, animal manure, or a combination of both. Results from this multi-locational participatory assessment showed that maize grain yield increased by 0.2 - 0.7 tonnes per hectare for every tonne of home-made biochar that was added to the field.\nOne household can produce 300 kg biochar per year by cooking on the gasifier stove. With this amount a biochar dosage of 1.5 t\/ha can be realized on an area of 0.2 ha per year. If biochar is not spread evenly, but along seed rows, its effective dosage can be increased. As the gasifier stove can be operated for 2-3 years, it is assumed that the costs of 50 USD, which are needed to purchase one gasifier, are good to equip 1 ha of land with an amount of biochar that results in increased crop yields.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation|Solar-powered farming systems","type_id":"993, 1188, 1044, 1045","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|Farm management|income increase|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 922, 919, 910, 1180, 914, 909, 915","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Kenya","country_origin_od":"1822","region":"Africa","region_id":"102","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"112","id":"34138","title":"Biochar application for land improvement","short_description":"Biological charcoal, or biochar, is porous charcoal obtained from biomass.

To obtain biochar, biomass is loaded into a kiln that can be heated to very high temperature (higher than 500 degrees Farenheit). The biomass goes through a process of biodegradation called pyrolysis.  After a few hours, this biomass is converted into a coal-like substance, which farmers can use as a soil amendment.  Biochar is an alternative way to solve the problems of the environment such as healthy soils, food production and global warming reduction.\nSuch charcoal production is a technology that can be conducted from the level of farmers to the level of industries. Lehmann and  Joseph (2009) collated research work related to the properties of biochar. It was found that biochar had a property of neutrality to alkalinity. It is porous, can hold water and has a composition of elements such as phosphorus, potassium and calcium - but especially carbon. Their findings indicated that biochar can absorb nutrients well, can withstand biological and chemical decomposition and promote activities of microorganisms in the soil. In addition to this biochar, through its positive effect on carbon sequestration, is another way to reduce the emission of carbon to the atmosphere - which is the cause of climate change through the greenhouse effect. Carbon is effectively locked in the biochar and not released. Much research has found that biochar is suitable for agricultural application. It improves soil properties physically, chemically and biologically. To work with biochar, we need a biochar kiln to produce it.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 922, 919, 909","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Thailand","country_origin_od":"483","region":"Asia","region_id":"103","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"113","id":"34139","title":"Biochar Application on Homestead Land","short_description":"Biochar is a carbon-rich solid formed from the organic residue by pyrolysis.

Applying biochar to soil has numerous benefits for improving soil health, such as enhancing soil fertility, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving soil microbiology, and reducing soil erosion. One of the most significant benefits of biochar is its ability to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide into the soil, which can help mitigate climate change by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Biochar can also remove contaminants from soil and water and serve as a compost component. \nBiochar also reduces the emission of ammonia and carbon dioxide (Cabeza et al. 2018), lowers soil compactness, optimizes compost (Liang et al. 2010), improves water retention and the sorption of heavy metals, increases the availability of micronutrients for plants and increases the pH of soils (Van Zwieten et al. 2010). Biochar also stimulates the growth of rhizosphere microorganisms and mycorrhizal fungi (G\u0142uszek et al. 2017). These bacteria and fungi may also promote plant growth (Compant et al. 2010). The pH values of biochars are positively correlated with the formation of carbonates and the contents of inorganic alkalis (Ding et al. 2014). The pH value of biochar ranges from 6.5 to 10.8. It is advisable to test the pH values of both soils and biochar to reach at the optimal quantity of biochar to be applied in the field. \nIn the Mandla district, agriculture is the backbone of the economy, and farmers are constantly adopting new farming technologies to increase their agricultural production. One such technology that has positively impacted more than a thousand farmers in the region is the application of biochar in homestead land under a GIZ-funded Soil protection and rehabilitation of degraded soil for food security in India (ProSoil) program. Biochar in this region is prepared using low cost Biochar Kiln units developed by Indian council of agriculture research institutions, traditional methods, such as digging soil pits and burning organic residue while covering its top with soil.  Since the Mandla district is a high-rainfall region, most farmers broadcast biochar over their fields before growing rabi (winter) crops. Commonly grown rabi crops in this region are mustard, vegetables, and maize.\nFarmers in the Mandla district use small units of biochar production. The recovery rate of biochar is 20%, with a capacity of 100kg of organic material. The application rate per unit area varies from farmer to farmer.\n1. Landholding: Farmers with more extensive land holdings or generally rotationally applied biochar in the parcels.\n2. The intervention of biochar application was introduced in this region in 2020. The new practice is evolving, and the application rate of biochar varies from farmer to farmer depending on the availability of raw materials and labour availability (family\/hired)\nThe most suitable biochar application rate is 10 \u2212 20 t\/ha. Moreover, it is essential to consider the compatibility and complementarity between biochar, soil texture, and management factors such as Nitrogen (N) application rate, pH values and growing environment into consideration (Yang Gao et al., 2021). More scientific studies are needed to define the quantity of biochar needed based on the local soil conditions. However, the current quantity of applications is very low compared to suggested in secondary documents. \nThe immediate effects of biochar application on crop production have been significant, with farmers reporting an increase in crop yield by 20-25% across most crops. Simple indicators such as increased grain weight and improved grain quality imply that the crop produced is of higher quality. Another critical benefit highlighted by farmers of biochar application is the retention of soil moisture over a longer duration compared to non-treated fields. Biochar can help the farmers of the Mandla district increase their agricultural productivity while promoting sustainable land use practices.\nCOMMENTS:\nField visits in Gabri and Changariya villages of Bichhhiya block were conducted to understand the technologyAs per the district census handbook of Mandla District 2001, the land use pattern of Mandla District is: 61% - under forest area, 21% - cropped area, 5%  - not available for cultivation, 7% - under fallow land, and 2% - cultivable area. The net area irrigated is 7% of the net area sown, which has hardly increased in recent times (~9%).\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Bioremediation and phytoremediation|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Frugal innovation|Social and socio-economic|Grassroots innovation networks|Low-cost farming tools and techniques","type_id":"993, 994, 1000, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1088, 1076, 1090, 1089","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 922, 919, 910, 914, 909, 917, 1180","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"India","country_origin_od":"370","region":"Asia","region_id":"103","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"114","id":"34140","title":"Biochar Production and Application to Improve Soils","short_description":"Biochar is generated through the process of pyrolysis (partial combustion)  of plant biomass like corn cobs or forest residues, in a heat-intensive, oxygen-free or low-oxygen environment. By spreading biochar on fields, the objective is to enhance the nutrient-holding capacity and structure of soil, and thereby to improve plant production.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Gatien AGBOKOUN CHRISTOPHEBiochar, a residue from the pyrolysis (partial combustion or \u201cthermal decomposition\u201d) of organic matter, can be used as a soil improver. The equipment required for its production is a pyrolysis system (e.g. a drum with a capacity of at least 120 L) and a biochar collection shovel. The biochar production process documented here involves burning corn cobs and crop stalks in a drum that is hermetically sealed with a lid and fitted with a vent. The drum is opened as soon as the residues are completely carbonized (at which point the smoke no longer emerges from the vent). This means the following requirements must be met:\n\u2022 H\/C (degree of carbonation): 0.38\n\u2022 pH \u003E 8, zero neutralizing value\n\u2022 Raw (90% \u003C 30mm)\n\u2022 Ground (90% \u003C 3mm)\nThe burnt residues are scooped up and cooled down with water. Then, the charred residues are scattered in the crop field. To ensure effective mixing with other fertilizing agents (compost, fertilizers, etc.), the residues must be finely ground. For tropical soils, experts recommend spreading 5 tons of biochar per hectare. To produce 1 ton of biochar, approximately 6 tons of cobs are needed, equivalent to around 12 hectares of maize. This dosage needs to be renewed every 50 years. However, in intensive market gardening with limited space, a higher dosage of up to 10 tons per hectare, or 1 kg per square meter, can be applied.\nThe recommended reduced dosage of biochar per hectare is 100 kg of ground biochar mixed with the NPK fertilizer dose for the specific crop to be spread 2 weeks after sowing (150 kilograms of NPK for maize or cotton). In practice, two volumes of biochar should be added for every volume of NPK fertilizer. Depending on the availability of organic fertilizer, an additional two or three volumes of compost or well-decomposed manure can be added, and the dosage of biochar should be renewed annually.\nTo ensure sustainability and scalability, it is important to:\n\u2022add organic matter to the biochar to enhance soil fertility;\n\u2022train a large number of farmers; and\n\u2022ensure easy access to biochar kilns.\nThis technology offers several advantages, including :\n\u2022increased plant growth;\n\u2022improved soil structure and physical properties;\n\u2022enhanced water retention capacity of the soil;\n\u2022increased availability of nutrients in the soil;\n\u2022promotion of humus formation;\n\u2022creation of a sustainable habitat for microorganisms due to its porous structure;\n\u2022accelerated composting and reduction of smells;\n\u2022long-term carbon storage in the soil; and\n\u2022reduced soil acidity and improved effectiveness of organic and mineral soil enhancers.\nApplying biochar to crops helps increase yields. For example, a plot without biochar yielded 1,000 kg\/ha of cotton, while a plot with biochar yielded 1,740 kg\/ha, resulting in a 74% increase. Similarly, maize yield can be improved by approximately 31% with the application of biochar.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 922, 919, 909, 910, 1180, 912","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Benin","country_origin_od":"287","region":"Africa","region_id":"102","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"115","id":"34141","title":"Biochar Production from the Invasive Species Lantana Camara","short_description":"Lantana Camara, an invasive species in India, negatively impacts biodiversity and agriculture. Biochar made from its biomass can help manage the species effectively. Traditionally farmers produce biochar in soil pit kilns. Another low-cost portable kiln unit of biochar preparation is a viable option for rainfed areas, designed to work on the direct up-draft principle with bottom ignition and circular vents for uniform heat transfer.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Santosh GuptaLantana Camara was introduced into India as an ornamental plant in 1809 by the British in Calcutta Botanical Garden. Lantana Camara negatively impacts biodiversity and native biota, disrupting the succession cycle, altering the structure and floral composition of native communities, and causing problems in agricultural lands in various regions of India. Its dense thickets outcompete native pastures, block the movement of grazers, and can cause poisoning. Its allelopathic activities also affect the growth of other species in its proximity. One of the measures to manage invasive species is by turning it into biochar. \nBiochar is the charred biomass produced by slow pyrolysis in which organic material is heated under controlled temperatures (300-500\u00b0C) without oxygen.  Lantana Camara is an ideal biomass for biochar production due to its high diversity and wide distribution. In addition to protecting ecosystems, invasive plant-derived biochar has potential applications in environmental remediation and soil amendment due to its unique structure, composition, and adsorption properties.\nIn the Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh, low-cost technologies for producing biochar are being practised. A low-cost portable kiln unit has been used in the Mandla District to cater to the needs of small and marginal farmers. One unit costs approximately Rs. 7000-12000 depending upon the design and location, including a metal drum, vent-making charges, and side fittings. The kiln is designed to work on the direct up-draft principle with bottom ignition. It is a vertical, single-barrel structure with a perforated base. The kiln has a square-shaped loading hole at the top, which can be closed at the end of conversion with a metal lid with a handle. The kiln has circular vents, a staggered arrangement to avoid rows, and a central vent to hold a wooden pole. Under open atmospheric conditions, the vents at the kiln base hasten hot gas movement through the bio-residues for uniform heat transfer by primary air movement. The kiln\u0027s top hole vents the released water vapours and hot gases. A strip of metal is welded around at 3\/4th height of the kiln, to which two metal rods are welded on opposite sides to serve as lifting jacks. Dry Lantana Camara feedstock is placed inside the kiln unit, and a fire is lit at the bottom. Through a pyrolysis process, the organic compounds present in the biomass decompose at a specific temperature in an oxygen-limited environment. \nPrior to use, the stalks\/twigs of lantana are manually cut into appropriate pieces 15-19 cm long and 0.9-1.0 cm in diameter using a commonly used axe in order to achieve better packing density. Dry residues are a prerequisite to hasten satisfactory and quicker conversion. The dried residues of lantana are placed in the unit and are burned from the bottom in an oxygen-limited environment. Generally, the burning process takes 6-8 hours through a slow pyrolysis process.  Once complete, the kiln is quenched with soil and left to cool for 3-4 hours. This simple and affordable biochar production method can help manage invasive plant species and benefit agriculture, the environment, and energy. The conversion ratio from biomass to biochar in the case of Lantana is around 20-25%. Farmers have reported of burning around 100 kg of dried Lantana biomass to get ~20 kg of biochar in one operation of the unit. The application rate of biochar varies from crop to crop and the type of soil and other characters. In studied project farmers do apply 20 kg of biochar mixed with 20 kg of cow dung and 20 kg of cow urine in an area of around 1 acre. \nThe burned biomass of Lantana after the process looks like the coal sticks, these sticks are pulverised through a pulveriser to make a powdered material for application in the field. The biochar is mixed with an equal quantity of cow dung and cow urine before the application. Some farmers also mix the native soils in biochar to get better results.\nCOMMENTS:\nFarmers from the Mandla District of Madhya Pradesh State in India use the cost-effective technology of biochar preparation from Lantana Camara.Lantana camara is a highly invasive plant species that can quickly spread and take over private and common land. The plant can spread rapidly by seeds or vegetative propagation, and it can grow in various environments. This makes it difficult to control once it has established itself in an area. Lantana Camara outcompetes native plant species, reduces biodiversity and alters ecosystem processes. Additionally, the plant can be toxic to livestock and wildlife, and its dense growth can increase the wildfire risk.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Manufacturing technologies|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1009, 1044","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 922, 921, 897, 898, 910, 914, 909","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"India","country_origin_od":"370","region":"Asia","region_id":"103","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"116","id":"34142","title":"Biodynamic composting","short_description":"A faster and more effective way to produce high quality compost in large quantities by surface composting using dry and green farm biomass piled in a heap.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Shreedip SigdelBiodynamic denotes a method of organic farming that emphasizes a holistic understanding of the interrelationships between soil, plants, and animals in a self-sustaining system. It excludes the use of artificial chemicals and stresses the importance of integrating farm animals, the cultivation of crops, and caring for the land. Fermented herbal and mineral preparations are used as compost additives and field sprays.\nPurpose of the Technology: Biodynamic composting is an inexpensive means of producing a large amount of compost within a relatively short time compared to other methods. It is ideal for farmers who require large amounts of compost, such as for orchards; or when several households get together to produce and share compost. This type of composting also helps to store soil carbon, assists irrigation practices that keep fields alternatively moist and dry, works to decrease the number of soil pests, and reduces methane emission. This practice not only enhances agricultural production as an on-site benefit to the land users but also contributes to the off-site benefits enjoyed by downstream land users, since it helps to reduce sedimentation and increases water availability.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The biodynamic compost is prepared as a surface heap rather than in a traditional pit. The heap is built on a flat, dry site away from shade trees and other elements that would promote water logging. The farmer marks out a rectangular plot of land according to his needs and places a set of logs or PVC pipes lengthwise in the middle of the rectangle to facilitate air circulation and help aerate the pile. Alternating layers of dry and green biomass are added on top. Rock phosphate and crushed slaked lime are added to the middle layers to enhance decomposition and to supplement the mineral content. Once the layering is complete, the pile is sealed using a paste made from soil and cow dung. Over the ensuing two months, the pile is watered weekly (through holes made in the plaster layer which are then resealed) and is monitored; any cracks that appear in the external plaster are sealed. At the end of this time, the compost is tested to check if it is ready by taking samples from a few different locations in the heap. When a crushed sample smells like forest soil, it indicates that the degradation is 80% complete and that the compost is ready to use.\nCOMMENTS:\nDemonstration Plot at ICIMOD Knowledge ParkMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Crop productivity is limited by poor soil fertility, intense cropping, and a scarcity of irrigation water. Farmers in the hills notice a marked decrease in the health of their crops and degraded soil conditions when chemical fertilizers are overused.

Biogas is the name given to the gas that is produced during the decomposition of some organic waste specifically to produce methane gas. The gas is then captured in a storage tank (on site) to be used for household energy needs. In many parts of the world where this technology is used (including Botswana) the most common form of input material is cow dung making it more appropriate for rural environments.\nPurpose of the Technology: Advantages: the technology offers two major advantages; first, at every level of use i.e. individual or institutional, savings in terms of energy is realized. The only costs that are borne are at installation, otherwise input of cow dung has a minimal cost of collection (if any at all). The second advantage is that there is reduced usage of fuel wood which translates into less cutting down of trees leading to reduced deforestation and degradation of land. A disadvantage is the initial investment which is significant for poor farmers.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Construction of the biogas plant: construction of the plant consists of three main chambers: namely, the Digester pit where all the microbiological reactions or decomposition of the material takes place. The digester has to be built to be air-tight with the released gas only escaping into the gas holder. The gas holder is connected to the digester by way of a pipe. Its main purpose is to collect all the gas that has been fermented. The mixing pit is the input chamber where the dung is mixed with water and fed into the digester. The amount and quality of water required for this is no constraint, even in this water stressed area. Construction the biogas plant has to be done according to specifications. A technical drawing of the plant is shown on page 3. The purpose of the technology is to use it for house-hold energy (for cooking, lighting and running appliances).\nNatural \/ human environment: In Botswana the technology was introduced by the Rural Industries Innovation Center which is a government funded research institution. Despite the existence of this company for many years, the uptake has been very low due to poor marketing and extension services and lack of financial assistance to poor farmers.\nBiogas is suitable either for a farm, cattle post or rural setting where the inputs (cow dung) are easily available. But there are possibilities of experimenting with other bio-degradable materials in major centres where cow dung is not readily available.\nCOMMENTS:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 0 km2.\nThis technology is basically on a point location, even though it is to benefit a wider area in terms of conservationMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Overgrazing of the commons, droughts, saline water and over-harvesting of fuelwood for cooking, heating leading to deforestation and land degradation\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Overgrazing of the commons, droughts, saline water and over-harvesting of fuelwood for cooking, heating leading to deforestation and land degradation.\nGrazingland comments: Biogass technology is not applied in the Boteti area at the moment, only at DESIRE test site.\nSelective felling of (semi-) natural forests: specific tree species are felled for fuelwood even though people are supposed to take only fallen-dead wood\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: Mixed cropping is the traditional practice but government extension advice promotes monocropping which the majority find expensive and risky.\nType of grazing system comments: Biogass technology is not applied in the Boteti area at the moment, only at DESIRE test site.\nConstraints of settlement \/ urban\nLivestock density: 1-10 LU \/km2\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation","type_id":"993, 1044","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change mitigation|Production|optimization of resource use for better production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"916, 925, 927, 917, 919, 897, 909, 899, 1186, 921","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Botswana","country_origin_od":"293","region":"Africa","region_id":"102","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"118","id":"34144","title":"Biogas Digester for Biomass Energy","short_description":"By established facilities and use organic matter of animal manure, human waste, plant straw for anaerobic fermentation to produce inflammable biogas for uses of lighting, cooking with the residue liquid and dreg for high quality organic fertilizer.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Yaolin WangThe demonstration site is located at Jingyuan County of central  Gansu Province, an arid county with annual rainfall of 240 mm for rainfed agriculture.

Adoption has significantly reduced costs for users, lowered greenhouse gas emissions, and provided organic fertilizer, enhancing crop productivity and livestock health.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  ONGPO LEPCHABiogas is a renewable fuel produced through the anaerobic digestion of organic matter, such as food or animal waste. Typically, biogas is intentionally generated in an enclosed environment (a biogas plant) for household consumption. This plant is constructed near a livestock shed for easy collection of animal waste and in proximity to households, mainly used for cooking, heating, and as an alternative to commercial LPG gas.\nThe plant can be adjusted based on the amount of animal waste, making it viable for smallholder farmers with just a few cows. In most parts of the country, the technology is modified so that even a small amount of animal waste can produce some gas. The digestion chamber is made smaller in diameter and height to generate enough pressure for the gas to reach the stove through the pipe. Initially, the Biogas project started to promote clean and renewable energy for household cooking, reducing the consumption of firewood. Currently, there are more than 8000 biogas plants of different sizes - 4 m3, 6 m3, 8 m3, and 10 m3, and a few large-scale biogas greater than 50 m3 in large individual dairy farms and government livestock farms.\nThe major activities and inputs required to establish and maintain the technology include having ample space around the residential area for the plant\u0027s construction. Additionally, materials such as cement, sand, gravel, stone, iron rods, pipes, pressure gauges, and a stove are necessary. Human resources are needed for the construction of the plant, and land users should have livestock (cows, buffaloes, horses, etc.) that can provide dung\/waste for gas generation.\nThere are numerous benefits and impacts of the technology, including its positive effects on rural communities, greenhouse gas emission reduction, maintaining carbon neutrality, and minimizing the use of imported LPG gas and chemical fertilizers. It also reduces electricity bills needed for operating electric heaters, saving time for land users who would otherwise collect firewood. The by-product (bio-slurry) from the digester is used as organic fertilizer, enhancing crop productivity and serving as a nutritious feed supplement for animals.\nLand users both appreciate and have concerns about the technology. They acknowledge the cost reduction benefits, citing the significant savings compared to market-priced commercial LPG gas and reduced expenses on operating electric heaters. The technology has also provided them with additional time by eliminating the need to gather firewood. The bio-slurry, a by-product of the biodigester, serves as fertilizer to enhance crop production and contributes to livestock waste management, improving livestock health and production.\nHowever, land users note that biogas plant establishment is expensive and may not be suitable for economically disadvantaged individuals. Some users experience challenges, such as the biodigester chamber failing to produce enough gas despite being constructed according to technical specifications. The daily requirement of adding animal waste to the input tank is perceived as tedious, and for land users with only one or two milking cows, supplying the required amount of animal waste for the biodigester chamber is often a problem.\nCOMMENTS:\nBiogas technology is used mainly for cooking  and heating at the household level.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation|Biofuels from agricultural waste","type_id":"993, 1044, 1047","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact|Farm management|income increase|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|crop production","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 916, 919, 922, 925, 910, 1180, 915, 898","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Bhutan","country_origin_od":"289","region":"Asia","region_id":"103","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"120","id":"34146","title":"Biogas system at household level fed daily with cattle manure","short_description":"Small-scale biogas systems fed with cow manure and water are implemented in order to supply the household with energy for cooking and lighting, as well as to produce fertilizer.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Christoph KaufmannIn this case-study, a small-scale biogas system was introduced in order to generate both energy for home consumption and fertilizer. Small-scale biogas systems are implemented in different parts of the world, however the layout thereof varies considerably.\nThe model used in this case-study consists of different components (cf. technical drawing). First, there is an inlet where the land user puts cow manure mixed with water. On the bottom of the inlet, there is a board which closes the access to the bio-digester situated beneath the inlet. The board can be opened manually by pulling a string. Once the board is open, the fluid components go through a pipe which leads to the bio-digester. In the bio-digester, bacteria transform the organic matter into biogas (mainly methane and CO2) and slurry. At the other end of the digester, there is another pipe (outlet). The outlet is lower than the inlet, and due to the difference in pressure, the slurry is pushed out of the digester. The slurry is dried and applied to the fields two to three times a year with the help of an ox cart. It has similar effects on the plant growth as chemical fertilizer as it does not build up the soil organic matter as much as compost. The biogas, however, is pushed to the pipe situated on top of the digester and can be utilized for domestic uses. The gas is used for cooking and lighting.\nThe use of biogas allows reducing the expenses on charging batteries for the lighting, as well as reducing the firewood use (usually from deforestation) for cooking. The slurry reduces the expenses on chemical fertilizer in the fields and has the advantage of killing the weed and rice seeds present in the manure and crop residues.\nFor building the biogas system, there is governmental and NGO support. These two actors finance half of the construction costs. The other half is paid by the land user. Building a biogas system is quite costly, with about 400 $, and not all of the land users in the area can afford paying 50% of its price. However, the costs borne by the land user are paid off within a few years due to reduced expenses on firewood, chemical fertilizer, and charging batteries. The construction itself was undertaken by local companies.\nThe costs are paid off within a few years due to the reduced expenses on firewood, chemical fertilizer and battery charging.\nThe analysed area is flat (slope \u003C 2%), tropic (dry and wet season), and the soils are mostly sandy or loamy. The soils contain little organic matter (low soil fertility, acidification, small amount of cattle, area has been deforested a long time ago) and the groundwater table is rather high (1-3 m during the dry season, on the surface during wet season).\nDue to climate change, the rainfalls are more erratic, temperatures rise and droughts are more recurrent. Rice is the predominant crop grown in the area, since it serves as staple food (mix subsistence and commercial activities). Rice is often grown in monocultures and harvested once a year. Once the rice is harvested (dry season), the cattle are released to the paddy fields. The cattle is often replaced by hand tractors, which effects the production of manure but allows a higher amount of crop residues on the fields.\nAs an addition to rice, most land users grow vegetable and fruits in small home gardens (subsistence) and complement their income by producing handicrafts or through off farm income \/ remittances from family members working in other places. The increasing migration rate (the young generation leaves the villages to work in the cities, garment industry or abroad) results in a decrease of available labour force in the area which has detrimental effects on the agricultural activities. Furthermore, the civil war in the 1970s (Khmer Rouge) led to the loss of agricultural knowledge which different NGOs try to re-establish.\nCOMMENTS:\nThere are only 4 households in this village which apply the technology (lack of money and\/or cattle).

In semi-arid environments, these structures consist of earthen levees built perpendicular to the slope of the land accompanied by a channel designed to retain runoff water and sediment between the banks.\nImplementing and maintaining these structures can be financially burdensome for farmers, necessitating biological consolidation to ensure their long-term viability. Consolidation can be achieved using various types of tree, pasture and fodder plantations. Successful biological consolidation is contingent on factors such as soil type (nature, relief), climate (particularly annual rainfall), irrigation water resources and the species chosen. Most farmers use olive trees to consolidate soil and water conservation structures in their plots.\nConsolidation efforts encompass both recent and aging structures, focusing on rehabilitation and ongoing maintenance. Planting occurs on the embankments and within their channels, providing essential plant cover and root systems that bind soil particles, reducing the risk of erosion. This technique has proven to enhance soil fertility, boost crop yields, and generate income for farmers through the sale of olives and olive oil. Despite the 10-15% loss of land surface associated with embankment installation, the consolidation process increases the overall value of the land.

Farmers usually address crop pest and disease problems through the use of agrochemicals. Especially bees, birds, and amphibians, which fulfil important functions in agroecosystems, are affected by high use of agrochemicals. The combination of inappropriate irrigation practices, incorrect application rates of agrochemicals, and low producer prices often lead, however, to poor income from smallholder irrigated agriculture and to further problems such as poor health, loss of biodiversity, and soil and water contamination. Amphibians are themselves proven biological pest control agents of arthropod pest species (predators of e.g. larvae of butterflies, beetles, termites, bugs and others) and the incorrect use of agrochemicals, as well as the removal of vegetation along field margins hampers this useful function. The technology described here aims to support and utilise the potential of amphibians (such as frogs and toads) as biocontrol agents \u2013as an alternative to agrochemicals in crops.\nPurpose of the Technology: Establishing habitats for amphibians is crucial in order to increase and secure their numbers: for example encouraging shrubby vegetation next to water bodies for arboreal frogs, and installing additional water ponds inside and around plantations for ground-living frogs. First, the local species pool of amphibians needs to be determined by visual and acoustic observations. Amphibian species do not need to be determined precisely, but it is important to detect whether they are arboreal and\/or ground-living amphibians, as these two groups have different roles as biocontrol agents. Pests that feed on the main cultivated species should be characterized by (a) collecting plant material to determine the type and quantity of pests and (b) by comparing observations with neighbouring farmers and extension agents. Pest species can be determined also by installing traps and using nets. Inspection should be done at least every 15 days to once a month during the whole rainy season to detect possible mass reproduction of arthropods after rainfall events. Once amphibians and pest species are detected, decisions on management strategies can be made. Such a strategy is to  create habitats for amphibians with additional sources of income, e.g. by planting pomegranate or guavas as shrubby vegetation structure for arboreal frogs. If pest species can\u0027t be reduced solely by amphibian species, the use of agrochemicals has to be reconsidered. Preference shall be given to chemicals which do not harm amphibians. Organic, self-made pesticides based on the extract of manioc roots (manipoera) seem promising. Twenty litres of manipoera, the bark of manicoba tree (Manihot pseudoglaziovii), a cup of American wormseed (Dysphania ambrosioides), a cup of yellow tagetes (Tagetes sp.), a cup of malagueta pepper (Capsicum sp.), garlic and a little bit of bleach have to be chopped, mixed and fermented for 10 days. Application of the final product (25 ml of organic pesticide diluted in 20 l of water) should be done every 8 to 15 days depending on crop species.\nNatural \/ human environment: Increasing habitat heterogeneity stimulates the diversity of amphibians and so a greater number of pest types will be controlled. Combined control by safeguarding natural amphibian habitats and application of organic pesticides is an innovative alternative to the overuse of toxic agrochemicals.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe technology was carried out both in a forest system as well as in agricultural areas. An incrasing SLM Technology area is linked to an increasing sampling number.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Intensive livestock grazing pressure, agriculture and logging of native vegetation are the driving factors behind loss of the Caatinga dry forest. The high use of agrochemicals additionally pollutes soils and watersheds, and probably also decreases local biodiversity. Droughts  seem to occur more frequently and these decrease water and food availability for livestock, as well as affecting the local fauna.\n Example for establishment of technology within study region: In the irrigation schemes of Petrol\u00e2ndia, Pernambuco, Brazil, the most important arthropod pest species in banana plantation was a weevil (Curculionidae, Coleoptera). The weevil (so called \u201cmoleque da bananeira\u201d) attacked the roots of the banana plants, in consequence the plant tumbled down and was lost. As the weevil stays during the day in the ground and only starts moving during the night, it is difficult to combat this pest species by agrochemicals. With an increase of small water ponds with a shore vegetation structure (for example at 2 corners of the plantation) the abundance of ground-living amphibians increases and so the presence of amphibians in the banana plantation which feed on the weevil during the night. \nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Droughts and consequently problems of feeding livestock on natural vegetation (lack of fodder and grazing grounds), deforestation, extensive and inappropriate use of agrochemicals, low producer prices.\nNomadism: goat, sheep, cattle\nSemi-nomadism \/ pastoralism: goat, sheep, cattle\nRanching: goat, sheep, cattle\nCut-and-carry\/ zero grazing: goat, sheep, cattle\nImproved pasture: goat, sheep, cattle\nMixed: (eg agro-pastoralism, silvo-pastoralism): goat, sheep, cattle\nSelective felling of (semi-) natural forests: Yes\nClear felling of (semi-)natural forests: Yes\nShifting cultivation: Yes\nPlantation forestry: Yes\nForest products and services: timber, fuelwood, fruits and nuts, grazing \/ browsing, other forest products \/ uses (honey, medical, etc.), nature conservation \/ protection\nLivestock is grazing on crop residues\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Biologicals|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices|Biotechnologies|Biofertilizers and biopesticides","type_id":"993, 2100, 1196, 1198, 1197, 1206, 994, 1001","use_cases":"Production|plant health|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|minimize pesticide use|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|income increase|field management","use_cases_id":"897, 906, 898, 916, 917, 926, 909, 910, 1180, 914","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Brazil","country_origin_od":"295","region":"Americas","region_id":"1463","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"123","id":"34149","title":"Biological Waste Water Treatment Plant","short_description":"The technology adopted is a treatment plant that treats and purifies waste water being discharged from the hospital biologically.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Sabita AryalIt is located in Dhulikhel Hospital premises, Kavre.

It is derived from the manure and other organic materials used to feed the biodigester \u2013 which is central to a biogas plant. The biodigester is fed with thoroughly mixed livestock manure and water. For instance, a biodigester with a capacity of 8m3 requires manure from 8 cattle mixed with 20 litres of water daily. This allows consistent production of biogas, and bioslurry as a byproduct.\nBioslurry is used as an organic soil amendment that serves as an alternative to chemical fertilizers. It can also play a pesticidal role. Increasing the use of organic fertilizer can reduce the money spent on inorganic fertilizer by at least half. It also improves soil structure via the addition of organic matter. Essentially, the organic matter content of bioslurry is about 20-30%. Appropriate application of the bioslurry as organic fertilizer leads to more moisture retention in the root zone and improves crop resilience to adverse conditions. Usually, bioslurry is applied around homesteads where the biogas plant is sited where it produces energy and light for the household. The main functions of bioslurry are improving soil fertility, increasing crop production, and deterring invasion by various insects. Applying filtered liquid bioslurry to the crop supplies available liquid nutrients and manages crop infestation such as by fall armyworms and maize stalk borer.\nBioslurry is a replacement for chemical fertilizers. It is applied in two forms: liquid and dry forms. The liquid form is mainly used around the homestead, using a watering can or bucket. The dried form can more easily be carried to fields for application. Bioslurry as organic fertilizer is applied to vegetables and other perennial crops around the homestead, once during the growing season. The overall application rate by smallholders is not necessarily based on the recommendation rate per hectare but on the availability of the by-product. Row application is the efficient and effective use of resources in short supply. The rate of application to the specific parcel is on a decremental basis. The end users are pleased by its merit of increasing production, reducing investment costs on chemical fertilizers, improving soil structure and associated properties. They also like the way it makes constructive use of a byproduct that needs to be disposed of. Nevertheless, bioslurry is only available to those who invest in costly biogas plants which also require intensive labour input to collect cattle manure and fetch water.\nCOMMENTS:\nIt is located at the homestead adjacent to the residence.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Biologicals|Biotechnologies|Biofertilizers and biopesticides|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 2100, 994, 1001, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|minimize pesticide use|plant health|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 909, 926, 906, 922, 918, 919","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Ethiopia","country_origin_od":"339","region":"Africa","region_id":"102","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"126","id":"34152","title":"Bitter gourd cultivation using recycled newspapers to protect fruits","short_description":"The use of old newspapers to wrap up bitter gourd, so as to prevent the fruit from being damaged by insects, and to protect them from direct sunlight and contact with pesticides.

However it is not recommended to grow it in areas with strong winds because then it takes longer to grow. Bitter gourd requires more fertile soil than other varieties in the Cucurbitaceae family. It needs to be well-saturated or loamy soil with a pH of 6 to 6.8. The most suitable land can be found along river banks, streams, and lakes with high silt content. Bitter gourds are susceptible to be damaged by pests and diseases. In order to protect the fruit from pests, plastic, paper or other materials are wrapped around the fruit. Additionally, the crop needs nets for climbing, which can be quite expensive (Agritoday, 2016).\nIn this case study the farmer plants bitter gourds by using bamboo sticks to construct the trellis for plant climbing.  And he wraps up the fruits with old newspapers. This growing technique is less expensive than using nets for plant climbing and medium A4 sized brown paper envelopes to protect the fruit. The bamboo sticks can be used for two years, and during this period the farmer is able to make use of them three to four times a year. The newspapers that have been bought to protect the fruit can be used two or three times, so as not only to reduce the cost but also to reduce the environmental impact. Covering the fruit with newspapers is better than using plastic bags or pages from books, because plastic bags can easily become too hot, and pages are particularly vulnerable to rain or water. The main purpose of wrapping up the bitter gourd with newspapers is to protect them from insects, especially the fruit fly. However it also protects them from the heat of the sun makes the fruit whiter, and acts as a protection against pesticides as this would otherwise be directly sprayed onto the fruit. Insecticides normally last an average of 7 to 10 days and plants will then have to be sprayed again to prevent the return of the insects. Farmers are able to harvest the bitter gourd about 15 days after pinned with newspaper.\nAs the area is flooded by the Mekong River during the months of August - October, it is not possible to plant bitter gourd in the rainy season. After the water has receded the soil should be ploughed and dried by the sun for 15 days. After this the soil should be plowed again, and then the field needs to be harrowed evenly and the soil left to dry for three more days. Fertilizers should not be added whilst ploughing. Planting is done by firstly using a hoe to scratch a central trench in the field. Further parallel lines to this trench should be 1.2 meters apart and the bitter gourd seeds should then be planted along the lines, at 40 centimeter intervals. Once the seeds are in the ground manure, cow or buffalo compost should be applied over the top and then watered. Before growing, it should be soaked for 2 hours and then covered with cloth. Afterwards they should be left to soak in a steady flow of water for 4 to 5 days until the shoots begin to grow. After when the developing bitter melon is 15 days old a bamboo pole with bamboo sticks of about 1.7 meters height and 10 cm from the plants has to be placed. A further 15 days after having put up the poles, the soil should be loosen up again and then the fish head fertilizer mixed with a little bit of UREA is applied. The fertilizer should be spread about 30 to 40 cm from plants, or it can be added between the bitter gourd clumps, which can also be combined with manure and UREA. Watering should be done twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. The irrigation system involves pumping water from a nearby lake. Even though pesticides are used regularly, if paper is not used to protect the fruits, they can still be affected by pests. Once affected the fruit falls down, becomes stunted, grows into irregular shapes, the color becomes dull. In case the fruit were directly affected by the poison it could be harmful to people\u2019s health.

Considerable nutrient losses often occur through the inappropriate handling or storage of compost and FYM. Drying out causes losses through volatilisation and rainfall whilst runoff causes leaching and the washing out of nutrients. To reduce nutrient losses, farmyard manure needs to be protected from direct sunlight, rainfall, run-on, and runoff.\nA number of improved composting methods have been tested and demonstrated with farmers in the Jhikhu Khola watershed. The Sustainable Soil Management Project (SSMP) has recommended black plastic-covered farmyard manure as one of the most promising methods. Farmyard manure is covered with a piece of black plastic to prevent nutrients from leaching out, to decrease evaporation losses, and to provide a more favourable environment for the growth of microbes due to the increased temperature and moisture content. This method is especially suitable for areas with low temperatures.\nIn this method, raw organic materials that are used for animal bedding - crop residues, leaves, grass, weeds and other organic materials -  are piled up or put into a pit in layers together with animal urine and dung. The pile is then completely covered with black plastic sheeting. This method is based on the passive aeration approach, the plastic sheet is removed from the heap each day to add more bedding materials. It is then covered again immediately. Maintenance is easy although care is needed to avoid damaging the sheet. The black plastic should be handled carefully while taking it off and returning it to the pile as the composting material may contain sharp-edged plant stems.\nThe method was found to be easy to apply and took little time and labour. In the Jhikhu Khola area, women are mainly responsible for preparing manure and carrying it to the fields. This technology reduces their burden as a smaller amount of black plastic FYM is needed to meet soil nutrient requirements compared to traditional FYM, which is normally applied in a poorly decomposed form and in large quantities.\nThe method was tested in the middle mountains of Nepal in the Jhikhu Khola watershed, located at 800-2200 masl and with 1200-1600 mm annual rainfall, about 70-80% in the monsoon months (June to September). The temperature ranges from 3-40 degree Cel. in the lower parts of the watershed and about 3 degree Cel. less at the higher elevations.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe black plastic covered FYM was tested at about 50 households of above mentioned villages Development Committees ( VDCs) and Dhulikhel municipality.major cash crop: Tomato, potato\nmajor food crop: Rice, maize , wheat\nother: Vegetables\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Crop production is limited as a result of soil fertility deterioration, high cropping intensity, and a scarcity of irrigation\nwater.

Grazing comprises \u201cbunching\u201d and rotational movement of all animals in herds.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Michael HergerLivestock production on Borana ranch is carried out under extensive grazing for beef, dairy, and sheep production.  There is strategic fattening and offtake for sales in harmony with conservation principles. The Borana Conservancy is a non-profit organisation, also belonging to the ranch \u2013 on the same land - dedicated to the sustainable conservation of critical habitat and wildlife. Ranching contributes financially to the running of the conservancy. \n\u201cHolistic Management\u201d (HM) as described by Allan Savory (1988) and promoted by Laikipia Wildlife Forum in Laikipia, is a method that integrates decision-making, planning, and livestock keeping. On the land, this means bunching of all livestock close together in order to act as a \u0022plough\u0022 and break the soil to help incorporate seeds and nutrients. Water also infiltrates better. The aim is to improve plant growth and thus soil. Furthermore, it means moving the animals together from block to block, by planned rotational grazing with resting periods. HM aims at managing high numbers of livestock and simultaneously restoring degraded land. However, Holistic Management principles remain controversial.\nLivestock herders employed by Borana move different herds of animals rotationally from one grazing area to the next. A defined grazing area lasts for around two months, with a resting period of six months. However, the grazing area and period vary a lot depending on rainfall. During the wet season, livestock usually spend more than two months within the same block. Cattle herds are split depending on their function as offtake for sales, or as breeding stock. The selling stock is located on the eastern side of Borana (currently 600 Head of cattle), while the breeding stock is on the western side (currently 1,800 Head of cattle). Sheep are grazed on the western side too (currently 1,200 Head of cattle).\nA calf stays with its mother until it is about six months old. Then a few males are selected as bulls, and all others castrated. At the same time females are selected for breeding to rebuild stock. Only one bull was purchased from outside, in 2013 which was a rare exception.\nLivestock are sold to butchers in local centres (e.g. Nanyuki, about 50 km distance), in the capital Nairobi (about 300 km away), and to the son of the owner, who runs a business nearby. Usually, only old and disabled cows are selected for selling.\nBorana helps neighbouring group ranches with improved genetics - and access to their land for fattening purpose. It also acts as a grass bank during droughts. According to Borana management, boundaries between Borana and community ranches, which once clearly defined the difference between managed and over-grazed lands, are becoming less clear.\nTypical of private ranches in Laikipia, Borana supports some of the highest densities of wildlife in Kenya. The wild herbivore biomass density on private ranches is estimated by Georgiadis (2007) at 14 ha \/TLU.\nCOMMENTS:\nMain animal species and products: Livestock: Cattle, sheep, chicken, pigs.

The bottom of the plastic bottle is removed and retained to be used as a cover. The bottle is then turned upside down and filled with water like a funnel. In this position, the lid of the bottle is twisted open very slowly until a drip rate of 5 drops per second is achieved. As soon as the desired water drip rate is reached, the lid is stuck to the bottle with some tape. At this drip rate 1.5 litres of water will drip out of the bottle every 90-100 minutes. The bottle is then buried in the soil next to the seedling with the wide part of the funnel sticking 10cm up out of the ground. The bottle\u0027s lid must be buried at the same level as the root collar. After this, grass, straw or black film is used to mulch the soil around the newly planted seedlings. Water drips slowly out and can go straight to the roots. Thus, no watering of the upper layer is needed. This technique also helps exclude evaporation of water from the upper layer of the soil.

In most newly planted British hedgerows, at least 60 percent of the shrubs are hawthorn, blackthorn, and (in the southwest) hazel, alone or in combination. The first two are particularly effective barriers to livestock. Other shrubs and trees used include holly, beech, oak, ash, and willow; the last three can become very tall.\nPurpose of the Technology: Hedgerows have many values and functions. A diversity of hedgerow types and management on a farm is ideal. The functions of hedgerows include the following: Shelter - hedgerows provide protection for livestock and crops for up to thirty times their height, a dense base is also more effective. Flooding control \u2013root systems of hedgerows regulate water movement and help prevent flooding. Disease control \u2013hedgerows help prevent the spread of airborne disease. Water quality \u2013 hedgerows trap silt and soil particles, which clog up fish spawning grounds if they enter watercourses . Wildlife - hedgerows have become very important wildlife habitats in the  countryside.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: New hedges should be pruned from an early stage to establish a shape and prevent leggy, unhealthy growth. The amount pruned back will depend on the type of hedge. The hedge is shaped as early as possible and tapered so that it is wider at the bottom than the top, ensuring the lower part will get the sunlight it needs for healthy growth. Once the hedge is established, regular maintenance will ensure it keeps healthy and neat. The hedge is cut by the eye , but it can be a good idea to set lines with lengths of string taut between canes. If a formal hedge has got out of shape, cutting it back severely is often the only remedy. But this method is not suitable for all species. Conifers, in particular, react badly if you cut into old wood.\nNatural \/ human environment: Hedgerows can be very effective at preventing loss of soil from fields, either through reducing wind erosion or through acting as a barrier to water-borne run-off. This is particularly so in arable areas, both where the land is flat and prone to wind-blow and in hilly areas where loss of soil following heavy rain can be a major problem especially in places prone to gully erosion.\nCOMMENTS:\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): High soil erosion due to both wind and runoff\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Reduced fertility due to loss of top soil\nFuture (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Cropland: Ct: Tree and shrub cropping\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|animal production","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 921, 922, 918, 919, 920, 910, 914, 897, 898, 899","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Kenya","country_origin_od":"1822","region":"Africa","region_id":"102","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"133","id":"34159","title":"Boundary Trees-Windbreakers","short_description":"Windbreaks are narrow strips of trees, shrubs and\/or grasses planted to protect fields, homes, canals, and other areas from the wind and blowing sand.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Paul KahigaWhere wind is a major cause of soil erosion and moisture loss, windbreaks can make a significant contribution to sustainable production.

This system is applied on gently to moderately sloping land (tanety) and is not suitable for steeply sloping plots. It can be used by all farmers, especially those with cattle, as it provides good quality forage. To ensure successful implementation, plots must be protected from livestock.\nPloughing is typically carried out in the dry season or at the onset of the rainy season. Land is either ploughed approximately across the slope, or by following contours where these have been marked out. In the latter case, contour lines should be surveyed at intervals of around 20 metres (or less), using stakes as landmarks during ploughing.  Where grass strips have been established, ploughing is carried out parallel with these.\nBrachiaria splits are planted in staggered lines along the contours. Alternatively seeds are used. This step is carried out at the start of the rainy season (December). The strips need to be protected against livestock throughout. These strips are left in place during the dry season, without burning or weeding. Over time, the plots evolve naturally into terraces.\nThis technology protects the soil against erosion by reducing runoff and increasing infiltration. It also helps maintain soil fertility, resulting in higher crop yields. Brachiaria provides excellent fodder for cattle and the strips become biodiverse. These plants are also relatively resilient to fire, maintaining their greenery even in the dry season. They can be a source of high-quality green matter for the manufacture of compost (especially \u201cbasket compost\u201d). From a practical standpoint, they have a high cost\/benefit ratio, requiring minimal maintenance. After the initial year, no resowing is necessary; the grass strips can endure for several years. Despite their merits, these strips have not been widely adopted, possibly due to limited awareness or a lack of Brachiaria cuttings among some farmers.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 898, 910, 914, 916, 917, 921, 918, 919, 922, 920","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Madagascar","country_origin_od":"396","region":"Africa","region_id":"102","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"135","id":"34161","title":"Broadleaf Plantations, Assisted Tree Regeneration and Fodder Nurseries for Sustainable Forest Management","short_description":"Natural assisted regeneration of broadleaved species, a small oak plantation and a fodder nursery have been established in the Nakina community forest (intervention area: 10 ha), supporting fodder tree species such as Banj Oak and Falyaat, as well as various subtropical temperate fodder grass species.

This is because broom grass has an extensive root system which can help to bind the soil. Additionally, farmers can generate an income from broom grass.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  kang phanvongsaClimate change has impacted agricultural practices and the livelihoods in rural mountain areas. Due to the occurrence of more volatile climate conditions including more frequent and intense rainfall in July and August, it has affected soil erosion on steep slopes. Therefore, broom grass was introduced to help stabilize soil composition and to prevent erosion and landslide.\nIn 2011 farmers at Chorlaving village, Ta-oy district started the technology by taking the broom grass rhizomes from the natural forest and replanting these on their own land which had been impacted by soil erosion. Their main objective was to prevent landslides that could impact their crops. At the same time it is also easier to manage and harvest broom grass on their land, which will be sold to merchants coming to the village. Most importantly, broom grass - a native species - has an extensive root system into a depth of 1 \u2013 2 meters that helps to bind the soil. Furthermore it is highly adaptive to local climatic and environmental conditions and is seldom affected by diseases or becomes a food source for animals (as its leaves are hairy and rough). For the collection of broom grass rhizomes simple equipment is needed. This includes blades, knifes and baskets. The rhizomes should be selected along steep slopes in mountainous areas. Then the stems are removed from the parent plants, whole young plant is removed including the root and culms of about 30 cm. The broom grass plantation of this case study area has a length of 300 meters and a width of 80 \u2013 120 meters on a sloping terrain with a gradient between 11-15%. The seedlings can be grown from healthy rhizomes collected in local forest areas, with approximately 6,000 seedlings per hectare. They are usually planted in April and May when the soil is still warm and stimulates the growth. To start off with, the farmers need to collect broom grass rhizomes from forest areas for one or two days. Afterwards they should be maintained for few days in a well shaded area, watered and covered by plastic bags. Land preparation firstly involves bush clearance. After, the farmers create rows by digging 20 x 20 cm holes at a distance of approx. 2 meters from one hole to the next. Planting may commence at the bottom of the field with the farmer placing 4 \u2013 5 rhizomes in each freshly dug hole as he moves upward the row following the contour of the land. Yangbong trees, but also other plants can be intercropped in every two rows of broom grass. The grass helps to retain soil moisture which promotes e.g. the Yangbong trees\u2019 growth. Once a year the broom grass area needs weeding and thinning. After harvest of the grass the cuttings and fragments can be used for mulching the soil surface around the broom grass stems and the trees. This not only retains soil moisture, but by the decaying process it enriches the soil by nutrients (natural compost).Typically, broom grass can be harvested 2 \u2013 3 years after it has been planted. During the rainy season (June to October), the roots and the new shoots of broom grass grow quickly. The strengths of a broom grass plantation are that firstly it prevents soil erosion and secondly its different elements (e.g. flowers) which provide a higher household income. Model farmer\u2019s broom grass plantation is 1.5 ha and may generate an income of around 2,000,000 Kip\/ton\/year. Currently, broom grass can be used for handicrafts, household products such as brooms and can also be sold to neighboring countries. There are currently many households engaged in planting broom grass for commercial purposes on their own land. This reduces conflicts among the village people araising when it had to be collecte in natural areas.\nWeaknesses: The root system of broom grass grows quickly which may result in the competition for nutrients and space with the other crops. Therefore appropriate management may be required by cutting and removing excessive rhizomes and culms. Furthermore, the roots can expand so extensively (difficult to remove when they grow up) that it would exceed the farmer\u2019s capacity to control them in order to get enough space for inter-crops. And planting broom grass on sloping terrain may cause difficulties to maintain and harvest the crop.\nCOMMENTS:\nMain crops (cash and food crops): Broom grass, Nothaphoebe umbelliflora\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Native species utilization|Living barriers|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1201, 1210, 1198","use_cases":"Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|field management|Production|crop production|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|disaster management","use_cases_id":"910, 1180, 916, 918, 921, 914, 897, 898, 917, 1154","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Lao People\u0026#039;s Democratic Republic","country_origin_od":"387","region":"Asia","region_id":"103","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"137","id":"34163","title":"Brush Layering","short_description":"The technology requires removal of invaders as resources for layering.

Their main function is to provide a permanent natural buffer to intercept and control nutrient and sediment transport from agricultural fields, by slowing surface runoff and thus promoting infiltration. Creating such green corridors is ecologically advantageous as well.\nLeaving field margins, headlands or strips around and between fields results in the natural germination and establishment of vegetation. Alternatively, buffer strips and hedges can be established deliberately according to a planting plan - which includes the species to be planted, their location and dimensions.\nHowever, land users usually prefer to cultivate the possible largest areas, so they do not like leaving wide strips of \u201cabandoned\u201d land.

Bush can be thinned manually (e.g. with axes), semi-mechanised (e.g. chainsaws) or fully mechanised (e.g. customised equipment). After cutting, the bush is left to dry and then processed into chips or other products.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Johannes LaufsBush thinning is carried out in Namibia to restore degraded rangeland by stimulating the re-growth of grasses \u2013 which are suppressed by excess bush. About 30-45 million hectares are affected by bush encroachment, and this affects biodiversity, groundwater recharge and the carrying capacity of rangeland. There are many causes of bush encroachment, including overgrazing and reduced frequency of wildfires. Most bush encroachment involves indigenous, rather than invasive, species.\nWhile natural transitions in the ecosystems may lead to reductions in bush encroachment, active rehabilitation measures are required for the short-term improvements. This is an absolute necessity for many farmers, who experience severe economic difficulties due to the reduced productivity of their rangeland.\nBush control comprises responsive measures (bush thinning), follow-up measures (aftercare) as well as preventative measures (good rangeland management). Since vast areas of Namibian rangeland are heavily encroached by bush, the focus is currently on bush thinning. This entails selective harvesting of bush. To determine the density of bush remaining after thinning, a formula based on tree equivalent (TE) and average annual rainfall is used. One TE is defined as a woody tree or bush of 1.5 metres in height.\nAs rule of thumb for attaining optimal bush density, about 30-35% of encroacher biomass should be removed. This is based on research carried out mainly in South Africa, measuring and comparing the re-growth after bush removal. Where too much bush was removed, this often resulted in even heavier encroachment.\nBush thinning follows strict environmental guidelines set by the Directorate of Forestry (DoF) through the Forestry Act and the Directorate of Environmental Affairs (DEA) through the Environmental Management Act. This governs the equipment used (to avoid soil disturbance) and the amount of bushes harvested (to achieve a healthy number of the desired bush species). The amount of bushes to be harvested is determined by an expert and depends on various factors.\nWhile there is a lack of precise knowledge on the long-term effect of bush thinning, there is no doubt that control has an overall positive effect on the savannah ecosystem in Namibia. The need is widely recognised among land owners and acknowledged on the national political agenda.\nTo render bush thinning economically feasible, value chains have been developed. Through processing and utilisation of the woody biomass, income can be generated. Processed bush biomass can, for example in the form of chips, can be used for thermal and electrical energy applications (e.g. local biomass power plants or biomass boilers for industry). Currently two such energy installations exist in Namibia, one at a local brewery and one at a local cement factory. In addition, the national power utility NamPower currently considers the construction of a 20-40 MW biomass power plant.\nOther existing value chains include the production of charcoal, firewood, poles, as well as bush -based animal feed. Further value chains under consideration include composite materials, such as wood-plastic, as well as biochar.\nScientific observations have shown, that bush thinning requires regular follow-up. These measures (\u201caftercare\u201d) include the prevention of coppicing and re-growth. This can be achieved by applying aboricides selectively to the cut stems, stem fires or the introduction of browsers (e.g. goats). Research on the effectiveness and possible side effects of each of these methods is limited.\nA major challenge is the limited suitability of available machines. The process leads to high wear and tear on the equipment (both harvesting and processing technology, (like chippers and pelletisers), often rendering operations unprofitable. Research into, and development of, more suitable machinery is necessary. Other requirements are improved skills training and continuous monitoring of the long-term effects on rangeland.\nCOMMENTS:\nPointers on the map only indicate points (e.g. urban centres) around which activities are concentrated. It is not possible to depict each site where bush control is implemented due to the high number of individual activities and projects.\nCurrently bush thinning is implemented on a total of approximately 120.000 hectares (1.200 km2) of farmland per annum. These activities are not confied to certain areas, but spread across all of Namibia, typically concentrating in the most encroached areas (e.g. Otjozondjupa, Khomas, Oshikoto and Omaheke regions).Main animal species and products: Cattle, goats, game\nNamibia is characterised by large commercial cattle farms. Du to its aridity the land is largely unsuitable for crop farming, with exceptions in high-rainfall areas such as the Grootfontein, Tsumeb, Otavi triangle. \nThe Northern parts of Namibia are managed as communal land, where farmers have lease holds for their land. In these areas a combination of millet production and cattle herding is common.\nNumber of growing seasons per year: 1\nLivestock density: 284 000 in targeted area (105460km2) of bush thinning (Otjozondjupa region).\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Harvesting and processing equipment|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1192, 1044","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change mitigation|Farm management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|income increase|field management|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 916, 927, 917, 919, 910, 915, 1180, 914, 921","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Namibia","country_origin_od":"416","region":"Africa","region_id":"102","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"143","id":"34169","title":"Cactus Cultivation","short_description":"This technology is based on the natural advantages and the multi-purpose usage of spineless cactus pear (Opuntia fiscus-indica), to cultivate marginal lands in central Tunisia, generating environmental and socio-economic benefits.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Joren VerbistThe central areas of Tunisia are semi-arid and receive less than 500 millimeters of annual rainfall . Most of these lands are considered marginal as result of land degradation. Marginal lands are often used as (unproductive) grazing land for livestock. To revitalize these areas and to benefit the local population, the International Centre of Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) and its national partners have investigated the potential of cactus as a crop (e.g. Opuntia fiscus-indica). \nSpineless cactus was already introduced in Tunisia during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but beginning in 1920-1930 cultivation for fodder production has gradually evolved. Opuntia is known for its invasive character, but the particular species being promoted -  Opuntia fiscus-indica - is non-invasive. The crop is well suited for the Tunisian context because the cacti can cope with high temperatures and grow well in (semi)-arid areas with limited rainfall. Additionally, the plant is very resilient as it can withstand a long dry season due to its high water- content and water-use -e\ufb03ciency, which are a result of its morphology (waxy cuticle, no actual leaves) and its Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM). In a CAM plant, stomata in the leaves remain shut during the day to reduce evapotranspiration, but open at night to collect and fix carbon dioxide (CO2). In general, cacti have multiple products that benefit local livelihoods. These are, for example, stable production of fodder for livestock and fruits for human consumption. Also, cactus can grow and produce requiring few inputs such as fertilizers, therefore marginal lands are well suited for cultivation. The main current risk for cactus cultivation is the risk of cochineal, an insect pest. \nTo establish a cactus plantation, the surface is ploughed to loosen up the often crusted soil. Then furrows are constructed in which the cacti pads are planted. Simultaneously, the furrows are partly filled with manure. The depth and widths of the furrows are 30 centimetres. The spacing between plants within the row is 50 centimeters and the distance between rows is 5 meters.\nA cactus plantation needs  weeding. Weeding is mechanically done by a plough in March to May. Harvesting of fruit is manually done by fruit-pickers in August to September. Cacti can also be harvested for their pads, which can be fed to livestock or used for outplanting. It is excellent fodder as it has a high nutritional value and high water-content. On average, a farmer following these agronomic practices generates an income of 800 USD per hectare. \nTo conclude, this documentation shows that the implementation of cacti is socio-economically and environmentally appropriate to cultivate marginal lands as cacti uses water and nutrients highly e\ufb03cient while reducing land degradation. Therefore, the out-scaling of cacti is very valuable and a practical option to fight land degradation and enhance smallholder\u2019s income.\nCOMMENTS:\nThis documentation is a example of how cacti are cultivated in Tunisia, which is done on many (\u003E100) farms.\nThe pin-points represent the provinces in which cactus are cultivated\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1203, 1206, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|animal production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|optimization of resource use for better production|livestock monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 898, 910, 1180, 914, 916, 918, 921, 915, 909, 905","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Tunisia","country_origin_od":"489","region":"Africa","region_id":"102","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"144","id":"34170","title":"Cactus Fruit Plantation in Arid Dry Lands","short_description":"This technology  is based on the natural advantages and the multi-purpose usage of spineless cactus pear (Opuntia fiscus-indica), to cultivate marginal lands in Jordan, generating environmental and socio-economic benefits.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Joren VerbistIn the arid parts of Jordan with limited rainfall, little irrigation, high water evaporation, poor soil quality and unsustainable land management result in land degradation (erosion and salinization) and productivity loss. Therefore, the International Center Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) and National Agricultural Research Centre of Jordan (NARC) organized field days (started in 2014) to disseminate knowledge regarding the cultivation of the cactus pear, Opuntia ficus-indica, cactus crop. Cacti can cope with high temperatures and grow well in (semi)-arid areas with 250-600mm annual rainfall or where irrigation is available. Additionally, the plant is very resilient as it can withstand a long dry season due to its high water-content and water-use -e\ufb03ciency, which are a result of its morphology (waxy cuticle, no actual leaves) and the Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM).

In general, cacti have multiple products that benefit local livelihoods, these are for example stable production of fodder for livestock and fruits for human consumption. Also, cactus can grow and produce requiring few inputs such as fertilizers, therefore marginal lands are well suited for cactus cultivation.\nThe market for cactus fruits is very promising in Jordan. Nowadays, there is high demand for cactus fruits as people grow fond of the fruits but also for medicinal uses. This documentation is focused on a farm covering roughly 10 hectares, where cactus was planted due to its socio-economic and environmental advantages i.e. the high prices for cactus fruits and the ability of cactus to grow in marginal lands with little input and cover the soil hence preventing soil erosion. However, the farm is not located ideally for cactus cultivation. Therefore, the farm is currently intensively managed in terms of fertilizer application and the irrigation. The previous land use was poor cultivation of barley to feed (grazing) sheep and goats. This led to little soil cover resulting in land degradation in the form of erosion. The farmer paid for the establishment of the cactus-plantation. The cacti are spaced by 4 meters between plants and 3 meters between rows. This spacing is specific for fruit production, in case of fodder production a higher crop density is recommended. The cacti are planted on the contours in pits (40 centimetres depth and diameter) to ensure rain-water collection and e\ufb03cient fertilizer application as the farm is situated on a 15% slope. The cacti reduce erosion as the roots hold the soil together. Field preparation for the establishment of the cactus field includes: (1) soil scrapping; (2) deep soil ploughing; (3) surface soil ploughing; and (4) pit digging. No fertilizer was applied in the establishment stage. Recurrent activities and costs are weeding, applying fertilizer and organic manure, maintaining the pits and harvesting. 200 kilograms per hectare of inorganic fertilizer (NPK) is applied between March and May. A total of 4 tons per hectare of organic manure is applied in September-November. These activities are non-mechanized, and therefore labour intensive.\nThe farm receives less than 200mm of annual rainfall and a public dam for irrigation is available. Therefore, the farmer invests in three water tanks to store water brought from the dam using his own truck, and in a drip irrigation system for high irrigation e\ufb03ciency. The farm is irrigated by 360 cubic meter per month, divided in three events. The costs per cubic meter is 0.95 Jordanian Dinar (JOD) (including transportation costs). Before the realization of the drip irrigation system, the cacti were watered by hand (19991-2015). During the initial three years, cacti produce no fruits making the short-term return on investment rather negative. Currently, the cactus-plantation produces 32.5 ton\/ha, equivalent to 65 kg \/plant. The average net income per hectare varies between 1650 JOD to 2750 JOD. This makes the farmer relatively medium- wealthy with respect to the area. Most costs are induced by labour as the farmer uses manual weeding, harvesting and fertilizer application.\nEven though the cultivation of cacti for its fruits on marginal lands has many benefits like the reduction in erosion, stable production, high output\/input e\ufb03ciency and good prices. There are some weaknesses, for example the relative young market of cactus products in Jordan compared to Tunisia. The Tunisian market for cactus products has a longer history, a high demand for other cactus-products like oil and juice and a better infrastructure (e.g. processing units) exist. These create more consistent prices for farmers, so less price drops during harvesting periods. Another weak point is the fact that cacti are cultivated in mono-culture. This significantly increases the risk of new pests and potential damage of the cultivated crop.\nTo conclude, this documentation shows that even though the selected farm does not represent an ideal site for cactus pear cultivation, the implementation of cacti is socio-economically and environmentally appropriate to cultivate dry marginal lands as cacti uses water and nutrients highly e\ufb03cient while reducing land degradation. Therefore, the out-scaling of cacti is very valuable and a practical option to fight land degradation and enhance smallholder\u2019s income.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1203","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|Farm management|income increase|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Access to markets|market forecasting for production and inventory planning","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 910, 1180, 914, 916, 918, 921, 920, 928, 933","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Jordan","country_origin_od":"381","region":"Asia","region_id":"103","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"145","id":"34171","title":"Calcareous soils management","short_description":"Managing calcareous soils through combined structural measures and chemical amendments methods for improving soil productivity and reduce land degradation\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Daniel Danano DaleThe technology is applied to facilitate drainage in calcareous soils (high calcium carbonate soils) that in addition suffer water logging.

Calliandra hedge barriers are a fairly cheap, effective, and sustainable way of controlling soil erosion and landslides on vulnerable steep slopes, especially where trash lines and Napier grass strips were inadequate to mitigate dispersed and concentrated soil and water runoff. Once established, the living barrier is durable with minimal additional maintenance cost to the farmer apart from pruning. The average length of a hedgerow is 50 to 70 m, corresponding to the width of a single terrace. The height varies according to intended use of the mature shoots. To use the stems as stakes, the hedgerow is allowed to reach a height of 4 to 6 m at maturity while a height of 1 to 2 m is sufficient for harvesting foliage as livestock fodder.  The hedge barrier reaches its mature, maintenance level after 12 to 18 months.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of the Calliandra hedge barrier is to reduce soil and water runoff.Calliandra is a leguminous shrub with deep roots that provids additional benefits such as soil stabilization and  soil fertility improvement through nitrogen fixing. Calliandra is a source of fodder and its flowers attract bees.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: At the beginning of the rainy season, calliandra seedlings are transplanted from the nursery (0.2m to 0.3m height) and  planted in a row (0.3m spacing).  In the early stages, gap-filling with more seedlings may be necessary as some fail to get established. A mixture of top soil and manure is applied in the spaces between the seedlings and watering is done to improve the seedling survival rate.  The distance between rows is 10 to 15 m and depends on the gradient of the slope. Establishment of hedges starts with construction of an earth banked terrace, creating a trench at the lower end of the terrace.  Calliandra seedlings are planted on the higher side of the trench.  Measuring off 10 m lengths upwards into the terrace, other rows of Calliandra seedlings are planted along the contour in order to achieve the inter-row spacing.  Establishment is manual labor intensive and therefore the community, organized as Farmer Field Schools, participates in the planting, one field at a time.  Simple tools such as hand hoes, sokajembe (pick-axe) and shovels are used.  Maintenance is achieved by weeding, mulching and cutting back.  For it to establish well, Calliandra needs to be weeded to minimize competition with weeds for water and nutrients . The weeds also harbour pests. It may also be necessary to mulch the area around each seedling during the dry season.  Where mulching is done, the mulch is placed at least 0.05m away from the plant to reduce pest attacks.  Calliandra calothyrsus trees are cut back at a height of 2m to between 0.15m and 1m to improve foliage which is used as fodder for livestock.  The hedge is then maintained at a height of 1 to 6 m depending on the intended additional uses.  The branches removed can be used as fuel wood or stakes, while leaves can be used as fodder.\nNatural \/ human environment: The hedge barrier may be attacked by pests.  Scales are white, powdery insects that attack Calliandra stems. Scales can be controlled using washing detergents such as \u2018Omo\u2019 dissolved in water and sprinkled on affected plants using leafy branches or a knapsack sprayer.  Black ants can seriously damage trees.  They can be controlled by spraying.   Other likely pests  are crickets and grass hoppers which affect seedlings in nurseries, and Armillaria mellea, a fungus that attacks roots of Calliandra plant causing root rot and eventual death.  Affected plants are uprooted and burnt.  In addition, calliandra is affected by hot, dry weather.  During the hot, dry weather, the hedge barrier becomes weak. However during the wet season it sprouts again, and, if well managed, becomes healthy again.  A well-maintained hedge barriers can last well over 20 years.\nCOMMENTS:\nBoundary points of the Technology area: -1.29294, 29.96006\n-1.29336, 29.96027\n-1.29327, 29.96084\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.03 km2.\nThe documented case study area is around 3ha\n-1.29371, 29.96095\n-1.29345, 29.96091Livestock density (if relevant): \n1-10 LU \/km2\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The slopes are steep \u003E30% to very steep \u003E60%), with very high precipitation (\u003E1440 mm).

The land users are members of Monpa Selwai Yoezer Tshogpa, a Community Forest Management Group which was formed to sustainably manage bamboo and cane resources, to preserve and promote age-old cane and bamboo handicraft skills and increase household income. The group is one of the most successful in promoting Tsharzo in the country. The group was formed under the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on 14 April 2000, and officially came into play in 2007, upon drafting bylaws. The bylaws were revised after the need for further improvement in the year 2018. The group received initial support from UNDP and Bhutan Orchids, a non-governmental organization (NGO). The government has given a total of 45 acres (18 ha) of land to the land users of Jangbi Chiwog to plant bamboo and cane. Out of the total, 15 acres (6 ha) are collectively managed as a nursery.  About 10 acres (4 ha) are managed by each village as a plantation. The land users have planted three varieties of bamboo on the land.\nThe benefits of the technology include the establishment of dedicated germplasm for bamboo and cane, sustainable harvest of natural raw materials, conservation and promotion of ancestral arts and crafts skills, social cohesion through group formation, and employment opportunities.\nBamboo and cane plantations play a great role in preventing soil degradation. Bamboo and cane have extensive root systems that help prevent erosion, stabilize soil, and reduce landslide risks. They are excellent for revegetation as they quickly establish themselves. Bamboo is also an efficient carbon sink, absorbing significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This helps mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations. Bamboo and cane provide habitats for various organisms thereby increasing biodiversity. Products made from bamboo and cane are biodegradable, minimizing any potential environmental impact.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe land use is not mixed.  The government has given a total of 45 acres of land to the land users of Jangbi Chiwog to plant bamboo and cane. Out of the 45 acres, 15 acres of land are collectively managed by all the land users of Jangbi chiwog for nursery raising. About 10 acres is managed by each village under the Chiwog for plantation activities. The land users planted three varieties of bamboo on the land. The land use is solely for cane and bamboo plantations.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Cooperative models and aggregation|Farmer producer organizations","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206, 1076, 1077, 1082","use_cases":"Production|forest products and logging management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|Farm management|income increase|Collective action and aggregation|indigenous peoples\u0026#039; rights|Access to knowledge and advisory|agricultural skills development|Governance, policy support and intelligence|support to certification schemes","use_cases_id":"897, 901, 916, 917, 919, 921, 910, 1180, 973, 1187, 965, 968, 980, 987","readiness_level":"","readiness_level_id":"","adoption_level":"","adoption_level_id":"","countries_adoption":"","countries_adoption_id":"","country_origin":"Bhutan","country_origin_od":"289","region":"Asia","region_id":"103","if_grassroots":"","impact_sdgs":"","impact_sdgs_id":"","actual_users":"","actual_users_id":"","prospective_users":"","prospective_users_id":"","owner":"","owner_id":"","owner_text":"","partner_text":"","data_source":"World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT)","data_source_id":"20007"},{"counter":"149","id":"34175","title":"Caragana Korshinskii Planting a kind of SWC vegetative technology","short_description":"Caragana korshinskii, a kind of perennial shrub, is used to protect soil from water and wind erosion, rhizobium in its root can increase soil fertility.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Jinsheng FUCaragana korshinskii is a kind of perennial and drought resistant shrub being used to protect soil from water and wind erosion.

VegaIn the Carbiocial Project viable land management strategies were explored to optimize the level of carbon in soil and water, helping to maintain and\/or improve ecosystem functions, under changing climatic conditions in the Southern Amazon and the Brazilian Cerrado. In the framework of this project, on-farm experiments were performed to enrich tropical agricultural soils in the medium term, with different types of organic matter (OM). In the experiment the effect of different types of OM amendments on soil carbon and macro-nutrients (N, P, and K), soil physical properties (waterholding capacity) and crop yield (soy biomass and grain production) were assessed. The amendments applied are locally available, and are either free (being waste materials) or considered cost-efficient.\nThe objective of this on-going experiment is to compare the impact of (i) the quality and quantity of OM applied, (ii) and the application methods (directly on the soil surface or incorporation by harrow) on soil chemical and physical properties. It is hypothesised that the addition of OM can enhance crop yields and, potentially, soil biodiversity. The effects of the different OM types, amounts and application methods were evaluated after one, two and three years. From the results, the aim is to provide recommendations for the development of soil OM-enrichment schemes and carbon-friendly landscape management programs for farmers, using local resources.\nThe experiment was established on an area of about one hectare on a ferrasol (red latosol) at the Rio Engano Farm, in the municipality of Campo Verde, Mato Grosso State. The farm has a total area of ca. 1500 ha, 830 ha of which are cultivated with  soybean and maize rotation, under a zero-tillage system, which is typical of many farms in this region. It is located in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna) biome at about 685 m a.s.l. This biome covers 2 million km2, which is 23% of the country area. It has a semi-humid climate with a pronounced dry season. The precipitation during the rainy season (September-April) varies between 800 and 2000 mm\/year.\nAt the beginning of the experiment (February 2012), three different types of OM amendments were applied. They comprised (a) sugarcane filter cake (Saccharum officinarum from ethanol\/sugar-production, (b) sawdust of peroba and cedrinho (Peroba jaune and Erisma uncinatum, respectively) and (c) coarse chips of Eucalyptus sp. Quantities applied were 0 (control), 6, 12 and 18 tonnes of each per hectare; using two methods: directly on the soil surface, and incorporated by harrow. There were three repetitions per treatment. The area was not fenced to allow the farmers to continue with their field routines on all plots. In February 2013, 2014 and 2015 soil samples were taken to analyze their chemical and physical properties. Soybean samples were also taken in February 2014 and 2015 to estimate biomass and grain production. From the initial results some conclusions can be drawn: 1) Organic amendment addition to ferrasols can significantly increase soil organic carbon, even in amounts as low as 6 t\/ha. 2) Amendments should be reapplied every 2 years. 3) The amendment type and application method does not have a significant effect on increasing soil organic carbon. 4) The addition of OM amendments is a win-win situation as a solution for organic matter waste recycling, and simultaneously to improve soil quality.\nThe area was not fenced to allow the farmer to continue with their arable field routines on all treatment plots. In February 2013, 2014 and 2015 soil samples were taken to analyze their chemical and physical properties. Soy bean samples were also taken in February 2014 and 2015 to estimate biomass and grain production.\nFrom our first results we can draw some conclusions:\n1) Organic amendment addition to Ferrasol can increase significantly soil organic carbon (SOC) percentage, even in small amounts such as 6 ton\/ha.\n2) Amendment reapplication should be done in 2 years intervals.\n3) The amendment type and disposition did not have a significant effect on increasing SOC.\n4) The addition of OM amendments is a win-win situation as a solution for organic matter waste recycling and to improve soil quality.\nCOMMENTS:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.011544 km2.\nIn the S\u00e3o Valentim Farm, located in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna) biome.

Furthermore, poisonus rat baits are attached on the trees in case the aluminium layers can not be used.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Michalakis ChristoforouCarob trees are attacked every year by rats who nibble the trunk stem of the tree, remove the bark of the trunk and the branches sucking the juice and eat the mature fruits. Rats nibble the bark of the tree in order to reduce their teeth size which tends to enlarge year by year. This results in the death of the tree branch or even of the entire tree. The tree may also show symptoms of hemiplegia. Rats run on the tree through the trunk. Apart from the direct effect of rat attacks on carob trees, rats also cause other problems to humans and animals. Rats are vectors for serious pest and diseases\nPurpose of the Technology: The rat population increases rapidly when there is enough food (such as carobs)  available, and the population grows even faster in the absence of natural enemies. . Through interrupting the access from the ground to the tree trunk, or by pruning the branches which are connected to the ground, the rats are hindered from climbing the trees. Rats can also be controlled through the use of chemical baits. However, these baits should only be used by experts who know where and how to place them in order to avoid that other animals come in contact with the baits. Natural enemies such as cats, snakes and birds (e.g. Bam owl (Tyto alba)) should be breeded and established on the carob trees, and farmers, hunters and locals should be informed not to kill the natural enemies of rats.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The carob trees can be protected from rats by covering the tree neck and trunk from the ground up to 1 meter with a hard material such as aluminium with a slippery surface. This way the rats are not able to climb the trees since they will slither on the ring layer.\nNatural \/ human environment: The carob tree protection will increase the production of carobs and therefore the income of the growers. Already established carob trees could provide a good income to growers with low production cost. The population of rats will decrease since the major source of food will not be provided anymore. Educating farmers, hunters and the local population about the benefits of natural enemies will allow that the environment regulates the rat population by itself.\nCOMMENTS:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 50 km2.\nCarob trees are grown in dry lands such as Pissouri and its sorrounding villages.

The channel is 0.5m deep and is lined with poplar trees that help stabilise the structure. The water runs down the channel from the top mountains, with water splashing onto the poplar trees. At the foot of the channel the water is used to irrigated cultivated land and provide drinking water.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of the cascading rock irrigation structure is to capture surface water run-off from the top of the mountain and channel it to where it can be utilised for human use such as drinking water, sanitation, and irrigation. The uneven surface of the rock channel slows the pace of the water thus preventing scouring at the foot of the channel. The channel also provides a suitable environment for the cultivation of poplar trees which in turn can help reduce water and wind erosion on the slopes, thus preventing rock and debris movement down onto the cultivated lands on the valley floor.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The channel is dug perpendicular to the steep slope and lined with stones gathered from the mountainous slopes. This activity is labour intensive, but can be more efficient with the use of donkeys. The stones are placed upon\/on top of each other in the base of the channel, and used to line the sides of the channel to retain the water. The soil along the edge of the channel is cleared of debris and stone until it is suitable for the planting of poplar cuttings. The cutting are supplemented with organic fertiliser. The channel is financed by the land owner, with voluntary support from the community.\nNatural \/ human environment: The cascading rock irrigation channel is located in a remote steep mountainous gorge where there is a shortage of land for cultivation. Water is in short supply, especially during the hot summer months. Subsequently the inhabitants have a high dependency on irrigated water from the top of the mountain range.

The cashews act as fence posts, and are reinforced with bamboo poles and\/or barbed wire. The living fences are used to either fence cattle into fields or fence them off, usually around the house. The fenced areas can be planted during the dry season. Without fences, the cattle are free roaming and use to destroy the crops.\nBesides fencing the cattle, the purposes of cashew living fences are the production of nuts and fruits, fuel, and soil enhancer. The nuts are sold, but there is no market for the fruits, thus they are fed to cattle or let to rot. The wood is used to cook or to produce charcoal; the ash is added to the compost. The leaves are gathered as well and added to the compost.\nAlthough cashews can stand waterlogged conditions, they prefer a well-drained soil. Thus a small berm is built up on the emplacement of the fence, and sown with cashew seeds spaced from 0.5 to 3 m. Cashews grow faster when directly sown than when transplanted. The spacing varies according to the farmers\u2019 purpose. If a higher production of nuts is intended, the spacing is wider; if the fence is more important, the plants are grown closer. Cattle do not eat the leaves and branches, thus do not need protection from grazing. One year after sowing the cashews, the trees are tall enough to act as fence posts and support bamboo pole as well as barbed wire. The bamboo is either gathered from the wild or grown in the fields and home gardens. The bamboo is fixed to the living posts with natural fibers\/vines or old clothes, and has to be replaced every two to three years to withstand cattle.\nThe analysed area is flat (slope \u003C 2%), with a tropical climate (dry season from November to May and wet season from June to October), and the soils are mostly sandy or loamy. The soil has a low fertility, contains little organic matter, and acidifies. The area has been deforested a long time ago, and the groundwater table is rather high (1-2 m during the dry season, on the surface during wet season).\nDue to climate change, farmers notice more erratic rainfalls, temperature rises and more recurrent droughts. Rice is the predominant crop grown in the area, since it serves as staple food (mix subsistence and commercial activities). Cattle are usually grazing on the fields after the harvest, without much control. Thus the cattle grazes too often and too much on the same spot, leading to degradation.\nThe increasing migration rate (the young generation leaves the villages to work in the cities, garment industry or abroad) results in a decrease of available labour force in the area which has detrimental effects on the agricultural activities. Furthermore, the civil war in the 1970s (Khmer Rouge) led to the loss of agricultural knowledge.

In the subsubsequent year, cassava tuber stems were cut at a length of 30 cm and planted in a hole of 30 cm depth and a spacing of 1 meter using the following required in puts: seed, hired labour, tractor,  ox-plough, hoes and pangas (axes). This technology integrated as well the construction of trenches within the field for soil and water conservation.\nThe application of this technology increased crop yields as evidenced by the land user. Crop rotation mitigates as well the build up of pathogens and pests that often occur when one species is continuously cropped in the same location. Crop rotation improves soil structure and fertility by increasing subsoil biomass from various root structures.  While promoting this practice, its important that  the landuser plants as well legumes for nitrogen fixation after cropping a nitrogen depleting  crop. Similarly, a low residue crop (i.e. a crop with low biomass) should be followed by a high biomass crop, like a mixture of grasses and legumes.  \nThe application of this technology requires the land user to subdivide the land into different portions for different crops. Crops could be planted in the following manner: 1) Cereals crop with legumes, 2) Deep rooted with shallow rooted and a cover crop.\nImportant to note is that crop rotation is good at preventing soil depletion, maintaining soil fertility, reducing soil erosion, controlling insect\/mite pests, reducing reliance on synthetic chemicals, reducing the pests\u0027 build-up and controlling weeds.

Seedlings were raised in nurseries, then planted on a 2.5 x 2.5 m grid \u2013 protected by palisades and irrigated at the initial stage. The filao belt covers an area of about 9,700 ha and effectively halts wind erosion and movement of sand dunes, resulting in multiple positive impacts on the environment and the 120,000 people living in the area: it provides protection of villages, allowing vegetable production in inter-dunal depressions, and last but not least - builds up resources of wood. Without the tree belt, life in the Niayes would not be possible. Furthermore, wind speed was reduced also on the sea side, making inshore fishery possible during the whole year (before it was limited to 3 months).\nThe big challenge is to gradually replace the stands of Casuarina trees that have reached senescence (after approx. 30 years). A management plan has been developed to assure the continuity of this important protective system.\nCOMMENTS:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 97 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Biological degradation: reduction of vegetation cover; Erosion by wind: loss of topsoil: uniform displacement, off-site degradation\nPlantation forestry: senescence of settlement\nFuture (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Forests \/ woodlands: Fp: Plantations, afforestations\nNumber of growing seasons per year: 1\nLongest growing period in days: 90 Longest growing period from month to month: July-September\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Drought-resistant techniques","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1203","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|Farm management|disaster management|Production|crop production|fisheries products management","use_cases_id":"916, 927, 917, 918, 919, 921, 910, 1154, 897, 898, 900","readiness_level":"9.

The trees provide shade for coffee, act as live fences, provide medicines, firewood, fodder, mulching material, bee forage; and some have pesticidal properties (e.g. Rauwolfia caffra). This multilayer system maximizes the use of limited land in a highly populated area, making sustained production possible with a minimum of external inputs, minimizes risk (less production failure, increased resistance against droughts and pests) and ensures at the same time environmental protection. The large species diversity provides both subsistence and cash crops.

The whole system includes main body of dam,  spillway, overflow and supporting measures. The check dam for land is a small dam mainly for land after it is filled up by the sediment from upstream area, from several years to 20 years in common, it could be flat land in the valley, not mainly for water collection (different from reservior).\nPurpose of the Technology: Check dams in the Loess Plateau are very common. There are many advantages. The check dam could not only reduce the erosion of the gullies, furthermore it retain the sediment in the flow and this decreases the sediment of the Yellow River. The check dam is good quality land for the soils because of the sedimentation of organic matter and other nutrients from topsoil . In this region soils are deep and very fertile because most soil is from the top soil upstream. The soil moisture of check dam is also much better than in any other places in the watershed because the flood should go away from its surface and the water inflitration is great in raining seasons.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The establishment needs enough money because it has to be safe enough, and the maintenance cost is not so high. The catchment with great soil erosion is better when we considered the formation time of land.\nNatural \/ human environment: The controlling area of check dam for land varies greatly from 30 square km or more.

The structure generally consists of construction of foundation, apron, retaining wall and the checkdam. The width of the checkdam ranges between 1 - 2 m while the height varies between 1 - 2 m depending up on the gully depth. The length of the checkdam depends on the gully width. The spacing between adjacent checkdams is determined based on two factors, namely, the gradient of the river bed and the availability of potential land that can be irrigated. It is also provided with a number of sluice gates which will be removed during the main rainy season to minimize siltation.\nPurpose of the Technology: In addition to storing water for irrigation, check dam ponds decrease slope length, slope angle, runoff velocity and minimize soil erosion.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Establishment of a check dam pond starts with collection and transportation of stone and sand. The construction is started by setting out the dimensions from the design on the selected site and excavating the foundation for the different parts, namely, key trench, apron and retaining wall. The check dam is then constructed using gabions filled with stones and tightly tied together with wire. Finally the superstructure is plastered using mortar to prevent the passage of water through the body. Gates of about 1 m wide are finally constructed at about 1 m interval and fitted with sluice gates. Maintenance usually involves fixing damaged gates and reinforcing gabions.\nNatural \/ human environment: Check dam pond is implemented in gentle (2 - 5%) and moderate (5 - 8%) slopes and in medium and light soil types of at least 1 m depth. It increases water availability for irrigation and livestock consumption purposes. It also reduces runoff velocity thereby decreasing soil erosion and enhancing gully rehabilitation.\nIt requires skilled labour and high construction cost. As a result, it is constructed through external support. However, the number of communities seeking for external support and willing to contribute their share is at the rise.

In this case study local species have been used to create check dams in gullies: these include jinocuebo (Simaroubaceaes bombacaceaes, and also jobo, tiguilote, pochote from the same family). Other suitable species are jocote (Spondias purpurea) and madero negro (Gliricidia sepium). As an option the pinapple-like pi\u00f1uela (Bromelia pinguin) can be planted in association with the stem cuttings to further reinforce the system. Tree stems are cut into pieces 5-15 cm thick and 1.5-2.5 m long, depending on the depth of the gully. The cuttings are planted to half of their length, and formed into semi-circular barriers (see diagram). The dams retard runoff and thus retain eroded sediment. Spacing between dams depends on the gradient of the gully bed. For example on a 15% slope it is recommended to build a dam every 4 meters (see spacing under establishment activities). Between dams, the gully gradually fills up with eroded soil, the speed of the runoff is further reduced and agricultural land that has been divided by the gully is reconnected. Large and deep gullies may change over time into a sequence of narrow fertile terraces where crops can be grown.\nHowever, the check dams should be seen as part of an integrated catchment management and protection plan, and thus be supported by other SWC measures on the lateral slopes, such as retention ditches and\/or live barriers laid out along the contour. Erosion and runoff control on the sides of each gully is an essential part of the rehabilitation process. These check dams of rooted poles are more robust and durable than stone dams in soils of sandy\/ loamy texture. On moderate and steep slopes a combination of stem cutting and stone dams is recommended.\nAfter two to three years the barriers should be pruned - yielding wood and fodder. Dead poles should be replaced and the dam widened if necessary.\nIn this case study the dams are constructed in a semi-arid region with erratic rainfall where gullies are common on agricultural land, be it cropland or grazing land. The land users are mainly peasant farmers, growing crops for subsistence on smallholdings, and living in very poor conditions. This system of gully rehabilitation is promoted by an NGO entitled \u2018Asociaci\u00f3n Tierra y Vida\u2019 through farmerto-farmer (campesino a campesino) extension.\nCOMMENTS:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 5 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): There is a range of factors that limit agricultural production in the area: soil degradation, extensive gully formation on crop land, low soil fertility, lack of inputs for crop production, erratic precipitation. Also, lack of interest\/knowledge and lack of resources hinder the implementation of SWC measures.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|disaster management|forestry management","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 922, 918, 917, 920, 910, 914, 897, 898, 1154, 927","readiness_level":"7.

Chicken manure is organic matter derived from animals (chicken), which can be used as organic fertilizer in agriculture. Chicken manure is high in organic matter making it desirable for use as a soil amendment or soil conditioner. It contributes to the fertility of the soil by adding organic matter and is nutritionally rich. It has the highest amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Chicken manure can improve soil structure and impacts microbiological activity and plant growth. The field should be ploughed and harrowed once with a tractor after which a uniform rate of 10 t\/ha of chicken manure is applied. One chicken produces about 150g of chicken manure per day. The farmers mix the chicken manure with straw. In majority the use of chicken manure as fertilizer increases the yield of the crops. It is necessary to control a level of nutrients in the soil.

ShoaibChoi Jhal (Piper chaba), locally called morich lota is a creeping vine that is grown in homesteads of saline areas.  It is adapted to soil salinity, grows under shade and is a very high value crop. It remains green throughout the year, reducing evapotranspiration from the soil and hence reduces capillary rise of salinity from shallow ground water. Choi Jhal  locally called morich lota, is one of the most popular and unique spices in the south-western region of Bangladesh. It is a flowering vine grown in southern-western districts like Khulna and Satkhira. There are two types of choi found in these areas. One is a narrow vine (20 - 25 mm diameter) and the other is about 2. 5 - 5 cm in diameter. It creeps up to 8-10 meters when allowed to extend on ground. On the other hand it also climb up large trees like Mango (Mangifera indica), Jam (Syzygium cumini), Betel nut (Areca catechu), Coconut (Cocos nucifera) and Kafula (Lannea coromandelica), etc.  Leaves and stems of the choi vine look like betel leafs (local name Paan; scientific name: Piper betle). Betel and choi are two species of the same family, Piperaceae.  The leaves of choi are oval-shaped and about 5-6 cm long. The flowers are monoecious and blossom during the monsoon. The fruit looks similar to other varieties of long pepper, with an elongated shape that can grow up to 6 cm inches long. The fruit is red when ripe, and turns dark brown or black when dry.  Chopped parts of the plant are cooked them with meat and fish, especially with mutton. The spicy pungent flavor of Choi Jhal is a year-round additive spice. In Thailand, P. chaba is known commonly as \u0022Dee Plee\u201d.\nThis technology was documented as one of the best practices that supports improved livelihoods of farmers who have no, or very little, cultivable land except their home yards. It is adapted to seasonal salinity in the dry season and waterlogging in monsoon.  Pankhali is a village  of Dacop Upazalia, Khulna where most of farmer practiced choi cultivation as their main income source. It is easy to propagate with cuttings of vines ideally of 50-75 cm with at least 4-5 nodes.  Generally no chemical fertilizer is used for its cultivation, rather domestic waste or compost is used in \u2018pits\u2019 at the time of planting vine cuttings. The cuttings of vines are planted in April-May or November-December in relatively higher areas of the home gardens, with loamy soils. Choi is shade-loving.  Approximately 2-2.5 ton\/ha could be harvested after 5-6 years. It could be harvested after one year, but ideally it is better to harvest after 5 years.   Farmers earn 1,000-1,500 BDT (US$1= 84 BDT) per kg from 5-year old choi. The mature roots are more valuable than the green vine. These days this product is marketed by many departmental stores of the city.\nThis expensive spice has great medicinal value, and tastes like pepper. It has been used to treat different kinds of diseases and it has a number of herbal uses, specially the antimicrobial and antioxidant active ingredients, Choi has 7% aromatic oil, 5% alkoloid and pepertin and in roots 13-15% peperin. The people of the area believe that it helps to remedy various diseases. One inch of choi can be used as medication for coughs.  Its price depends on its thickness, and different thicknesses of Piper chaba taste different.  Thicker ones are popular for its flesh and thinner ones for their spicy heat.\nCommonly the twigs, stems or roots both fresh and dried forms are used in this area as a spice. Sometimes it is ground and used as an ingredient in a variety of sauces and pastes. It is a relatively expensive spice and the roots are usually more expensive than the stems because of their stronger aroma. It  is mainly used as a taste enhancer. It makes the food spicier. It is also used in Jhalmori, Pickles, Halim and for making tasty soups.\nCOMMENTS:\nChoi Jhal is grown in most of the homesteads as a valuable crop.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1196, 1203, 1206, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 918, 921","readiness_level":"9.

Effective canopy management is crucial for achieving desirable outcomes in citrus cultivation, such as improved fruit quality, increased yields, efficient use of resources, and enhanced tree health.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Nima Dolma TamangCitrus canopy management practices remain basic in Bhutan. Thus, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) project was initiated and demonstrated citrus canopy management practices in selected orchards in 2010. In the same year, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) project trained land users and extension officers in eastern Bhutan on citrus management practices such as planting methods, nutrient management, pruning and training including top working, fruit thinning and post-harvest management practices. Since then, citrus growers have been slowly adopting the practices in their orchards. However, the adoption rate is low - affecting the yield and quality.\nBhutan has suitable climatic conditions for citrus production, particularly in the southern parts of the country due to the subtropical climate. Citrus such as oranges, mandarins and lemons are grown in orchards and home gardens. In Bhutan, citrus canopy management practices focus on optimizing tree growth, fruit production, and overall tree health. The main elements include pruning, training systems, canopy density management, tree height and size control, and disease and pest management integrated with irrigation and nutrient management practices. Pruning involves selectively removing branches, shoots, or foliage to shape the tree and improve its health.  The stump should always be cut as close to the collar region as possible. Training structures the tree in a specific manner to optimize growth and management. Canopy density management regulates foliage density for light penetration and airflow. Techniques such as hedging or topping control the height and size of trees. Disease and pest management practices include adequate air circulation and sunlight exposure. Integration with irrigation and soil nutrient management enhances tree health and productivity. The desirable shape and size of citrus are variable depending on the grower\u0027s choice, location, and - most importantly - operational health and safety concerns. In general, the desirable shape and size of the tree should be 2 to 5 m tall, 2 to 5 m width of canopy, and 4 to 6 primary (scaffold) branches that are at least 1 m above the ground level.\nThe purposes\/functions of citrus canopy management technology are to optimize fruit production, improve tree health, and facilitate harvest and maintenance operations. It helps maximize fruit yield and quality. Pruning and maintenance practices enhance tree vigour, reduce the risk of diseases and pests, and improve overall plant health. Controlling tree size and shape makes harvesting easier and more efficient, and simplifies other maintenance activities such as irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.\nTo establish and maintain citrus canopy management technology, activities such as regular pruning and training, knowledge and skill development, use of proper tools and equipment, monitoring and assessment, irrigation, and nutrition management are required. Regular pruning and training of citrus trees according to the selected system and management objectives is essential. Monitoring tree growth, health, and productivity is important, along with proper irrigation scheduling, water management, and nutrient application.\nThe benefits\/impacts of the technology are improved sunlight exposure, enhanced air circulation, reduced disease incidence, increased fruit size and quality, ease of harvest, consistent yield, optimized water use, better pest management, and others. A well-managed canopy makes it easier to access the fruit during harvest, and achieve higher yields and better-quality fruits, reduced need for pesticides, as well as directing nutrients toward fruit production rather than excessive vegetative growth. However, there are some drawbacks of the technology such as the requirement for time-consuming manual labour, lower initial yields, high initial investments for equipment, and concerns about over-pruning.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|plant health|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|equipment management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 906, 910, 914, 909, 912, 913","readiness_level":"7.

Citrus orchard of  oranges  (Citrus sinensis ) with grass mulch and trenches is established on gently sloping land with grasses every year. The trenches are established within the citrus orchard for soil erosion control and environmental and water conservation.To establish this technology the land user will (1) identify an already planted Orchard of Oranges  susceptible to soil and water erosion problems, (2) clear the grasses in the garden using a panga, (3) dig the trenches using a  hoe, a spade  and labour up to a depth of not more than 0.5  centimetres, (4) carry and lay the mulch to the garden  using at least  3-4 workers per day  with the grass mulch kept at a minimum distance of 20 centimetres away from the plant to allow for air circulation, (5) remove the sediments and re-apply them back to the field once the trenches are filled with the sediments. Mulched grass decomposes over time, improves fertility while trenches allow water harvesting and prevent soil and water erosion. However, the land user needs to be aware that trenches are labour intensive which could be the most expensive input, in addition to the cost of basic construction materials for digging trenches like a hoe, a panga and a spade which are in most cases bought once and used for a longer period of time. The benefits derived from this SLM technology are high in the long run as the technology is suitable for improving soil fertility and controlling soil erosion with the established grass mulch and trenches. Trenches and grass mulch retain water during heavy rains which is utilized by citrus during the dry season. The leaf litter from a  citrus  garden with minimum tillage when decomposed provides manure to enhance crop production generating increased income from the sale of fruits. However, this technology requires labour for planting,  cutting the grass , watering and constructing the trenches which accounts for most of the costs.  What is not liked about this technology is that the trenches are not easy to make  and are labour-intensive.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Frugal innovation|Social and socio-economic|Low-cost farming tools and techniques","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1206, 1088, 1076, 1089","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|income increase|water use optimization for sustainability|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 910, 1180, 920, 914, 915, 918, 922","readiness_level":"9.

Under this technology, urban municipal waste is composted and used as organic fertiliser in agriculture. This relieves the cities\u2019 waste management, enhances rural soils and in turn improves farm productivity.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Santosh GuptaIn India, over 377 million people live in almost 8,000 cities or towns. They generate 62 million tons of municipal solid waste annually, according to the country\u2019s government. More than 80% of such solid waste is deposited indiscriminately without treatment at dump yards in an unhygienic manner. In the Indian countryside, the ecological sustainability of agriculture has been at risk due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and monoculture since the \u2018Green Revolution\u2019 led to the degradation of land. \nCity compost is one of the solutions to both problems. Waste collected by municipal corporations is processed to make compost. During this process, organic waste is collected in the cities, recycled, processed to compost, and finally used as organic matter by farmers complementing the traditional farmyard manure. In such manner carbon that is contained in the waste is recycled back into the soil thus enhancing agricultural production.\nNashik Municipal Corporation in Nashik town of Maharashtra State in India has set-up a waste processing plant in the town. This plant processes the city\u2019s organic waste into compost through a scientific process. The processed city compost is packed into bags of 50 kg each and these bags are supplied to fertilizer companies and further on to farmers. There are Government subsidies available to farmers for the purchase of compost bags subject to documentary proofs and other conditions. \nUnder the \u201cSoil Protection and Rehabilitation for Food Security (ProSoil)\u201d project of GIZ, farmers and FPOs (farmer producer organizations) have been supported for the application of city compost in their fields. Supported by the implementing agency WOTR (Watershed Organization Trust) the city compost application in farmer\u0027s fields in 3 districts of Maharashtra namely Ahmednagar, Jalna and Dhule has been introduced. Interventions covered more than 3000 farmers and around 1100 Acres of land. The entire intervention is implemented with the help of FPOs, which procured the city compost from \u2018The Nashik Waste Management Centre\u2019 and sold the procured material further to the farming communities. This has ensured easy availability to the farmers without incurring undue travel cost. Farmers applied the city waste compost in their farms during the month of May\/June (before the onset of monsoon) to different crops. \nCity compost was applied to different crop combinations such as paddy-chickpea in Dhule District (moderate irrigation facility), greengram-sorghum in Ahmed Nagar District (Rainfed conditions) and soyabean-wheat in Jalna District (irrigated conditions). Farmers have seen the benefits of city compost across all crop combinations and geographies. The application of city compost has been of benefit to farmers in reducing the usage of synthetic fertilizers along with reducing the dependency on farmyard manure as it is getting scarce day by day. Farmers have also realized the improved soil health leading to better productivity of their farms. \nThe Indian government has also launched several initiatives to promote the use of city compost in agriculture. For example, the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture provides financial assistance to farmers for the purchase of city compost, and the Fertilizer Control Order allows the use of city compost as a fertilizer. Although developing city waste as compost and its application in the farmer\u0027s field is a nascent approach from the India Government and other stakeholders, however looking at the availability of waste, the commitment of the Indian Government through its \u2018Clean India Program\u2019 and the vast issue of synthetic fertilizers usage and high subsidy burden, the use of city compost in agriculture has the potential to contribute to sustainable solutions in the area of waste management while improving soil health and reducing the use of synthetic fertilizers in India.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe intervention is implemented with around 1100 farmers across the 3 districts namely Ahmednagar, Jalna and Dhule in the Indian state of MaharashtraThe intervention is mostly applied on cropland.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Biologicals|Nature-based solutions|Integrated management systems|Institutional|Partnerships|Farmer producer organizations|Social and socio-economic|Cooperative models and aggregation","type_id":"993, 2100, 1196, 1197, 1116, 1135, 1082, 1076, 1077","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|minimize pesticide use|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 922, 919, 926, 909","readiness_level":"7.

Objectives are the protection against natural hazards and the promotion of forest restoration within this area. Ayora was declared to a ZAU in 1997 due to its high risk of fires. In the \u201cPlan de Selvicultura Preventiva de Incendios en los Sistemas Forestales de la Comunidad Valenciana\u201d which became operative in 1996 and whose main objective is the reduction of the fire risk, the ZAU is practically addressed for the first time in the establishment of firebreaks (\u00e1reas cortafuegos). Based on this plan, the firebreaks were established within a pilot project \u201cProyecto Piloto de Selvicultura Preventiva\u201d between 1998 and 2002, carried out by the company VAERSA (public company of the Generalitat Valenciana).\nA firebreak is a strategically located strip on which the vegetation cover has been partially or totally removed down to mineral soil with the aim of controlling the spread of large forest fires. The main purposes are 1) to interrupt the continuity of hazardous fuels across a landscape to decrease the area affected by fires, 2) to provide areas where fire fighters are protected and can work more efficiently, 3) to slow down a fire, to reduce the fire intensity and caused damages, and 4) to provide strips where fuel management is facilitated. The total surface protected by the firebreaks is 33\u2019851 ha while the management measures are executed on 1944,81 ha. This technology is also applied in other countries, e.g. Portugal, South Carolina or South Africa.\nThe establishment and maintenance are labour-intensive and expensive. Firebreaks can range between a protected area of 2000-6000 ha (first order), 500-1500 ha (second order), and 100-300 ha (third order), together forming a system isolating separate areas by wide strips. This parcelling aims in limiting the burnt area to a maximum of 6000 ha. Each firebreak consists of a bare vegetation-free strip (banda decapado). The width of the bare area ranges between 6m (first order), 3m (second order) and 1.5m (third order). Existing vegetation-free areas (e.g. roads) are used to establish firebreaks to have less visual impact. If there is no road, trees and shrubs have to be cleared and chipped entirely using chainsaws and special tractors. On each side of the bare area there is a totally cleared strip (banda de desbroce total). The width depends on the climatic zone, the order and the hazard of fuel, therefore ranging between 28m (first order), 11m (second order) and 6m (third order). Almost all the existing vegetation is cleared, only some isolated mature trees are not cut if they do not contribute to the propagation of a fire. On both sides of these strips there are auxiliary strips (banda auxiliar) where selective clearing is applied until reaching a desired density. Sick trees are cleared with priority. Species of high ecologic value and low flammability level are not cleared, such as Juniperus phoenicea, Juniperus oxycedrus and Quercus ilex ssp. rotundifolia. The width of these elements can vary according to the prevalent conditions. A part of the wood generated by the clearings is used as fuelwood, the other part is chipped and distributed on the soil as mulch. Firebreaks are often located on mountain ridges and created with 45\u00b0 to the dominant wind direction (west) to facilitate fire extinction.\nThe maintenance of firebreaks is extremely important. Without clearing, fire-prone species will encroach which decreases the effectiveness of the firebreak. The maintenance is realized depending on the vegetation, usually in firebreaks of first order the maintenance is done every 2 years (\u201cdecapado\u201d and \u201cdesbroce total\u201d) or every 4 years (\u201cbanda auxiliar\u201d) while firebreaks of second and third order are cleared every 4 years. In the here described project the maintenance was carried out in three phases (2001-2004, 2004-2008 and 2008-2012).\nThe region of Ayora is mountainous with a dry subhumid climate (~380 mm annual rainfall). The risk of fire incidence is at its highest from June to September when there are adverse conditions like drought, high temperatures and strong winds (mainly the winds coming from central Spain, called \u201cponiente\u201d). The population density is very low and there are only few job opportunities (e.g. marginal agriculture, grazing, hunting, beekeeping, artisanry, wind mill parc). Most of the inhabitants work in the nuclear power plant. Forest management could be a source for jobs.\nCOMMENTS:\nBoundary points of the Technology area: The above indicated coordinates only show one firebreak (first order). But there is a whole system of firebreaks which is visible in the Google Earth file.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): In Ayora, the prevalent dense shrublands (dominated by seeder species), which resulted from past agricultural land use (changes of the vegetation composition, e.g. removal of key species), land abandonment\/rural depopulation and fire occurrence, contain a high fire risk because of both the high fuel loads and their continuity. Also dense forests (either afforestations or natural regeneration) show a high risk for fires. Through the modifications of the vegetation composition in the past (removal of more fire resistant resprouter species (mature forest), whereas fire-prone seeder species are now spreading), the resilience of the ecosystem to fires has decreased. Today a higher fire recurrence can be observed which could still be worsen by future climate change impacts, undermining more and more the ecosystem\u2019s capacity to buffer such shocks. Before the implementation of firebreaks, it was almost impossible to stop a fire and it was much more dangerous for fire fighters. There was also no access for fire-fighting vehicles.\nSelective felling of (semi-) natural forests: As a management practice. The forest should be cleared more frequently since there is a huge amount of fuel.\nClear felling of (semi-)natural forests: Within the firebreak\nPlantation forestry: Almost the whole forest in this region was planted\nNumber of growing seasons per year:\n1\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Farm management|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"910, 1154, 916, 927, 918, 919, 917, 921","readiness_level":"9.

The pipes are retrofitted with new and climate-resilient technology. Such a climate-proof irrigation system is designed to better withstand extreme weather conditions.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Tshering YangzomThe climate-resilient irrigation scheme in Khomshar Chiwog under Bardho Gewog (Block), Zhemgang Dzongkhag (District), was funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF), UNDP-Bhutan. The 3.9 km irrigation system was designed with a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe system benefiting 150 households with a command area of 955 acres (approx. 386 ha). The total irrigation cost incurred was Nu. 18,055,180 (approx. USD 225,700) and was completed in 11 months (7 December 2020 - 7 November 2021). The irrigation scheme was officially handed over to the community on 27 August 2021, upon the formation of a water-user group (WUG).\nThe smart irrigation system consists of key components, viz. intake, sluice gate, silt-cum-inlet tank, flush-out valves, air release valve, water distribution points, and tail point. The intake collects and diverts the water from the source to the sluice gate. The land users were taught to maintain the intake by regularly clearing it from bushes and removing debris. The sluice gate controls the flow of the water into the tank based on the water requirement. The silt-cum-inlet tank holds the water to settle out sediments and debris before clean water flows through the pipe at a constant rate. Flush out valves clear the sediment and debris from the tank. The air release valve vents out the air trapped in the pipe and water distribution points. Water distribution points deliver water to the users, as required, up to the tail point where water is discharged.\nThe irrigation scheme fulfils the need for a continuous water supply for both drinking and irrigation purposes. To ensure sustainability, a WUG headed by a chairman, a secretary, and a treasurer was instituted. The WUG ensures operations, maintenance, and harmonious distribution of water. The group is also responsible for the safety of the irrigation system.\nThe main reason for considering such irrigation scheme as being \u201cclimate resilient\u201d is that unlike open earthen channels, this type of irrigation scheme results in zero loss of water through evaporation and leakage, as it is a closed channel. Furthermore, being closed, it is not prone to blockages caused by landslides triggered by rainfall. There is also complete end-to-end management, i.e., management at source including the watershed, and management at tail-end.\nThe irrigation scheme was constructed by a private company through a contract award: community members were not involved. The irrigation scheme was also accompanied by a land development programme (bench terracing) by a separate contractor, with the prospect of transitioning to irrigated paddy cultivation in the future after adequate soil stabilization. More than 90 acres (36 ha) of fallow lands were revived. This blended approach was applied to ensure the food self-security\/sufficiency of the beneficiaries.\nThough at a very initial stage, the construction and operation of the irrigation scheme have brought happiness to the beneficiaries. They expressed their hope and expectation of improved crop production, stable and reliable water availability, and major fallow land reversion.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|Farm management|field management|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 920, 918, 910, 914, 921, 909, 912","readiness_level":"7.

By applying the rat tunnels, infiltration can be increased, soil salinization can be prevented without affecting the growth of the crops and occupying croplands. Good effect can be achieved by combining rat tunnels with closed conduits in application. Closed drainage refers to burying the drain pipes underground and letting the underground water flow along the fissures between the pipes and penetrate into the tubes and drained. In a field, if rat tunnels and closed conduits are combined for use, the rat tunnels constitute the first-grade drainage system, the closed conduits constitute the second-grade drainage system; the stagnant water in the plough layer penetrates through the soil and rat fissures and converges into the rat tunnels; While draining the water inside themselves to the outside, the rat tunnels collect the inside stagnant water and guide the water into the closed conduits, through which the water is discharged. In this way, the surface water can be discharged in a relatively thorough way.\nIncrease of soil infiltration, rapid discharge of direct surface runoffs, prevention of soil salinization.\nIn building such a project, the closed conduits should be built first, followed by the building of the rat tunnels; the closed conduits should be under the rat tunnels, the included angle between a closed conduit and a rat tunnel should be 90\u00b0.\nThe gap between two neighboring laid closed conduits should be 50m-100m. The burying depth of a closed conduit should be 80cm-90cm, the area around the closed conduit should be evenly laid with a layer of coarse gravels 5-8cm in thickness. After the project on the closed conduits in a field is accomplished, restore the flatness of the field surface, then undertake the operation on the rat tunnels.\nIn building the rat tunnels, a tractor is directly applied to pull the mole plough in accordance with the designed distances. When the tractor moves forward, the mole plough goes deep into a specified depth(generally 60cm) of soil layer and generates through piercing the soil along the direction of the forward motion of the tractor a tunnel(rat tunnels) whose diameter is equal to bullet diameter and which is in parallel with the ground surface. The separation distance between two neighboring rat tunnels is 1-5m. The service life is generally 2-5 years. If the rate of flow of a field obviously decreases, new rat tunnels should be built by averting the original routes.\nAfter a rainfall, check whether the rat tunnels have collapsed. The service life of the newly laid closed conduits is over 20, however, new rat tunnels should be built every two years.\nRat tunnels are mainly distributed on the Three River Plain, which is the largest marsh distribution area.

In addition, slowing the flow results in a larger surface area of water and infiltration is increased. Wet spots created this way improve aquatic biodiversity and wildlife. A downstream benefit is that land users at a lower elevation are less affected by runoff, floods and sediment deposition. However a disadvantage is the risk of damage to surrounding fields - caused by wild animals attracted to the wet conditions and increased biodiversity.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204, 1198","use_cases":"Farm management|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"910, 1154, 916, 917, 920, 918, 921","readiness_level":"7.

Beside this, the use of coconut leaves mulch for covering rows of winter melons helps to prevent soil erosion, improves soil fertility, reduces weed growth, and increases soil fertility following the decomposition of the plant residues.  The soils best suited to winter melon cultivation are loamy and sandy loam soils with a soil pH of between 5.0 and 6.3 and soils along the low-land areas.  If the pH soil is lower than 5.0, the melon growth is not good and may accelerate the ripening of the fruit before the appropriate time, with the fruit plants sometimes dying due to lack of nutrients (TSTD, 2012). The roots of the winter melon are able to grow in soil with a depth of between 65 and 100 cm, particularly sandy soils. This crop is not suitable for cultivation in areas which are wind prone because of increased moisture loss through plant evapotranspiration. Such areas are also sometimes prone to high temperatures which are also unsuitable for winter melon.  \nThe implementation area for this study was 280 squares meters, with a row height of 20-30 centimeters, a row width of 1 meter, row length of 40 meters, and row spacing of 1.5 meters.  There were a total of 8 planted rows, with 40 melon stems being planted into each row.  The crop stems and the intercrop space between the rows is covered with coconut leaves by laying the leaves along the slopes of the melon crop, with  5 or 6  coconut leaves as mulch along the two sides of the crop. In order to save time and water, farmers used drip irrigation using a pipe irrigation system that could provide water at a rate of about 6 liters per house, twice daily (in the morning and evening).  Irrigation was provided over 20 minute periods at a rate of 100 ml per minute (although this was reduced during the rainy season).  The watering technique is not required to fill the basal area of the stem of growing winter melon plants.  Water is generally not provided at noon or late evening as watering at this time can cause problems, such as rotting of roots.  If the soil around the stem becomes dry, more water should be applied at short notice without waiting for the soil to dry out. This is particularly important in the period immediately after planting of the seedlings, when water and nutrients are important for initial plant growth.  Also, during the flowering and fruiting phases of melon plant growth, water needs have to be closely monitored. As the soil had previously been used for sugarcane cropping, the nutrient status of the soil was low, so farmers have improved the soil nutrient status by adding some organic fertilizer (cow manure) and some chemical fertilizers in an appropriate manner. In addition, some pesticides have been used as well. \nIn general, the advantage of this technique is the low cost materials which are locally available, such as coconut leaves, and materials which can be purchased in the local market, such as drip pipe, black plastic string, etc. However, the important aspects of the adoption of this technique, besides improving soil quality and maintaining a stable environment, is that it provides practical and potential economic benefits to farmers of about 800,000 (US$ 200) Riel per season.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|water use optimization for sustainability|income increase|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 921, 909, 920, 1180, 926","readiness_level":"7.

On hillsides, planting improved tree\/coffee fallows on the degraded upper section of bench terraces is a recommended practice to improve soil fertility while cropping continues on the lower terrace to maintain food production.\nPurpose of the Technology: Fewer inputs and less labor required. Shade trees reduce alternate productions, thereby ensuring a more balanced income for coffee farmers. Timber and firewood production improves coffee farmer incomes. By spreading income over several crops, these systems are economically less risky than coffee\nmonoculture. Financial incentives for pilot projects helping to preserve biodiversity, soils and water quality can be applied, Bonuses are being considered for carbon sequestration in coffee plantations converted from a monoculture to an agroforestry system. The erosion of fragile mountain soils is reduced. Soil fertility is conserved. Exploitation of natural forest reserves is limited. Biological and faunistic diversity is safeguarded.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Agricultural intensification, moving along the gradient from agroforests grown with a diverse and dense shade canopy to those agroforests with only a few coffee trees to monocultures with only one crop species or cattle pastures, by definition includes a reduction in the planned biodiversity. Agricultural intensification also results in a loss of associated biodiversity.

Thus, they learnt how to cultivate coffee and brought their knowledge to their villages due to suitable natural conditions there. Temperature suitable for coffee there ranges from 15 \u2013 25\u00b0C and pH levels of soils between 5.5 and 6.5, average rainfall between 1000-1500 mm\/year, and altitude of approximately 800 m.a.s.l. Subsequently, small coffee plantations were observed all over the region, but failed soon because the villagers planted coffee intercropped with upland rice within their traditional extensive slash and burn practice. One of the reasons of very low coffee yields was the lacking shadow and the inconsistent humidity during dry season.\nIn 2009, a project supported by IFAD promoted coffee cultivated between big trees as a trial to villagers in Paksong District. But the selection of \u201cMai Thorng\u201d (Erythrina stricta Roxburgh) - a type of savannah tree that provides enough shade to coffee plants - unfortunately was not successful as well, as it was not adapted to the local climate. Therefore, in 2012, Mr. Bouathong in Chalurnxay village, Xanay district of Attapue province tried to use locally grown trees which provide adequate shade to the coffee plants. They started to clear carefully fallow fields from vegetation whilst preserving bigger trees (age of fallow 5- 10 years and older). This included most of the trees older than 5 years. The clearance has to be conducted in January by removing smaller trees and shrubs. However, it is important that the remaining trees do not create to excessive shadow, as coffee plant needs approximately 50-60 percent of sunlight to grow well. The space between the seedlings is 3 x 3 or 4 x 3 meters. The size of the planting holes is 50x50x50cm. Before planting of coffee seedlings organic manure has to be filled in the hole to improve soil fertility (5kg\/hole). To establish such kind of coffee plantation following inputs are needed: coffee seedlings, sunlight protection sheets, watering pot, fork, plastic bags for the seedlings, and organic fertilizer. The most important input is the labour for selective clearance, land preparation, and fencing (around 5 to 10 workers for 1 ha). From the very beginning a wooden fence out of timber from previously cleared small trees has to be installed for getting protection against livestock damages. Also weeding (3-4 times a year) and thinning of tree branches is required. The decayed plant material can be used as soil cover to increase natural soil nutrients and to control storm water from run-off.\nOutcomes from this method indicated that coffee plants grow successfully with healthy stems and suckers, and dark green leaves. And coffee plant survival rate of 80 percent was far higher compared to the rate of only 50% in former plantations without trees. Three years after planting coffee plants produces coffee beans.\nCoffee now is playing an important role for the local land users regarding revenue generation. The coffee prices in mountainous areas of Xanxay District vary depending on species and range from 5,000 to 8000Kip\/kg for fresh coffee beans; 12,000 to 16000Kip\/kg for threshed coffee beans (average annual income 5,000,000Kip \/ household). Estimated production of fresh beans is between 4,000-5,000Kg\/ha. Yields significantly increase compared to old plantations that provided only 500-800Kg\/ha.\nPurpose and advantage of this technology include the use of fallow and degraded forest areas to the benefit of local land users such us improved land use rights and reduction of land conflicts because of stabilization of shifting cultivation. People are required to find animal manure to fertilize the coffee plant, but they can also use coffee bean husk as green compost around the coffee plant, as this promotes soil nutrients, soil organisms (e.g. earthworms), and it keeps soil moisture and increases soil porosity. Benefits of this agroforestry that reduction of slash and burn practice. The coffee cultivation in a agroforsestry system as permanent land use practices reduces pressure on forest land, increases the forest canopy, preserve bigger trees as habitat for local animals, and promotes higher plant diversity. Furthermore, people can collect local mushrooms and other edible plants\/vegetables such as Phak Varn, Phak Koum, rattan shoots, ferns, and others.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|forestry management|improving soil management practices|climate change mitigation|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|field management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 917, 927, 921, 919, 915, 914","readiness_level":"7.

Catchment areas are fields that are infected by invader species on riverbanks, and catchment areas that extract enormous amounts of water out of the system.  The trees (Black wattle - Acacia meansii) are cut or ring barked.  After the trees are felled, large areas of bare ground are exposed.  In order to prevent soil erosion until the natural succession processes are completed and the area is in equilibrium with the rest of the environment, soil needs to be stabilised and sometimes also rehabilitated.\nThese exposed areas must first be treated with a follow-up to prevent the coppice, re-growth and seedlings from growing again.  Sometimes in agricultural grazing areas, the bare areas are re-seeded with natural climax grasses, and in urban areas left to be stabilised by successional species, or pioneers and aveads etc.  The small branches of the felled trees are packed on bare areas, after the re-seeding to stop the topsoil from eroding.  This reduces the off-flow and flow speed of the rainwater, lowering the raindrop impact, increasing the moist regime and preventing wind erosion.

It is particularly effective in areas with no fences, and areas with high incidence of stock theft and predator losses. The technology aims to replace continuous, open grazing with a planned system. This gives grass a chance to recover in the growing season, and prepares the soil and grass for the forthcoming rainy season. In addition, fixed stocking rates based on carrying capacities are replaced by flexible stocking rates which track availability of forage. Two grazing plans are developed for one year; one when perennial grasses are growing and the other when they are dormant. Grazing plans may change, depending on the season and unanticipated events such as fire. A grazing plan is put in place for the growing season, that ensures plants are not re-grazed before they have recovered their root reserves. It is targeted at good animal performance . In the non-growing season, animal numbers are adjusted to ensure that there is sufficient grass to last until the next rains .\nThe grazing plans must take into account all factors that affect livestock performance as well as capacity of the livestock owner . These factors include occurrence of the first rains, presence of natural water pans, current and projected animal performance, availability of good quality forage for cows prior to bulling, avoiding poisonous plants, and timing of vaccinations, etc. Once the plan has been developed, the animals are moved by herders using low stress handling techniques to various parts of the farm or communal grazing area, according to the plan. Strategic moving of livestock by herding enables fire breaks to be created by deliberate over trampling. Each night the livestock are brought back to a kraal ( Afrikaans for corral) where they are kept overnight. Watering of livestock can take place in the kraal at night, in the morning, or alternatively in the field depending on water availability. This process is repeated day after day by the herders.\nAt the end of each growing season, the amount of forage available to the current herd is estimated. Animal numbers are adjusted to make sure that there is still sufficient forage to support them before the rains \u2013 and to leave enough ground cover to feed the soil organisms and protect the soil from erosion. Deciding when the forage produced will run out needs to be done using a method that livestock owners relate to. Livestock owners may decide to meet and reach consensus on this based on their knowledge and past experience of the effectiveness of rainfall. If it is decided that there is sufficient food to see the animals through until the next rains, then livestock owners will be satisfied; if there is excess forage they may be able to re-stock. If, however, a forage shortage is expected then de-stocking is required: the severity of the forage shortage determines how many livestock can be carried on the land during the off-season. Again, livestock owners can reach consensus on this. Deciding whose animals to sell and how many is always a thorny issue, so livestock owners will always move excess livestock to other areas if possible, or alternatively sell unproductive animals.\nCOMMENTS:\nAnimals are herded over the entire area \u2013 except areas that are too steep for livestock to walk up.Main animal species and products: Livestock, increased forage production, improved animal performance.\nNumber of growing seasons per year: 1\nLivestock density: Livestock density is high as a result of herding, but stocking rate varies.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Animal management machinery|Digital technologies|Nature-based solutions|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1188, 1195, 1015, 1196, 1197, 1206, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|livestock monitoring|animal health|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 905, 907, 910, 914, 909, 915, 916, 921, 918, 919","readiness_level":"9.

The aim is to restore degraded lands by planting endemic trees like the baobab and n\u00e9r\u00e9, whose leaves and fruit are very commonly used for food and medicinal purposes.\nThe main objective of this activity is to improve women\u2019s production of trees and vegetables, while ensuring infertile lands are restored. Market gardening also contributes to (i) raising farmers\u2019 incomes through the production of peppers, okra and shallots, (ii) developing the shallot sector, and (iii) building farmers\u2019 capacities.\nThe plot measures 100 by 100 metres. The planted and living species are: 60 baobab saplings (Adansonia digita), 120 papaya saplings (Carica papaya), 43 n\u00e9r\u00e9 saplings (Parkia biglobosa), 26 lemon tree saplings (Citrus lemon), 2 tamarind tree saplings (Tamarindus indica), 21 grafted jujube saplings (Zizyphus sp). The vegetable beds are created in between the lines of trees. The vegetable growing site measures 105 by 100 metres (an area of 10,544 square metres). It is provided with farm equipment and machinery, including wells, distribution basins and wire fencing around the entire perimeter. It also contains: 9 Acacia albida saplings, 156 baobab saplings and 78 papaya saplings.\nThe vegetable growing season runs all year round and is divided into three crop productions. During the cold season from October to March, shallots are planted; in the hot season from March to June, okra is grown; and in the rainy season peppers are grown. Women work 100% of the site. There is a 90% adoption of the growing calendar. Okra and peppers benefit from fertiliser inputs and the techniques used for growing shallots.\nCritical issues requiring attention are women\u2019s poor access to the developed land and the scarcity of equipment, particularly for processing okra and shallots.\nLocated in the urban commune of Djenn\u00e9, the \u2018Benkadi\u2019 cooperative was a beneficiary of SADeF funding in 2009\/2010 (for its micro-project to develop a one-hectare market garden scheme). This cooperative was the product of the transformation of Syn women\u2019s collective, which undertakes individual and collective activities, and focuses on the sustainable management of natural\nresources. It was set up on 22 May 1998 and its headquarters are located in Syn. More than 130 women aged between 18 and 50 make up the cooperative, and nearly 30 cooperative members work the site. The main collective activities undertaken by the Syn-based \u2018Benkadi\u2019 cooperative company are: farming a biodiverse market garden plantation; operating a market garden; implementing a tontine (investment plan); fattening up livestock; growing ground nuts and tree growing; handicrafts. Concerns exist regarding enlarging and enhancing the site\u2019s dewatering system to improve women\u2019s accessibility to the developed land. Members are willing to provide at least 30 women to work the site each day.\nSADeF\u2019s installation of the market garden has enabled more than 100 women to take part in income-generating activities. The women have produced and traded: 20,069 kilograms of shallots per year; 150 x 100-kilogram sacks of peppers per year; 429 sacks of dry baobab leaves; 6,090 papaya fruits; 15,700 kilograms of okra. The output from the 2011 growing season made a profit of 12,242,620 CFA francs (23\u0027690 Dollar).\nCOMMENTS:\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): degraded and bare land\nLivestock density: 1-10 LU \/km2\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Native species utilization|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Cooperative models and aggregation|Farmer producer organizations","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1203, 1201, 1206, 1076, 1077, 1082","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|field management|Collective action and aggregation|cooperative management to improve efficiency and governance|Supply chain management|support to food processing|Access to knowledge and advisory|access to agricultural advice|agricultural skills development","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 917, 921, 914, 973, 974, 939, 943, 965, 967, 968","readiness_level":"8.

The technology described here focuses on the benefit of the rotation programme focusing on 5-year rotation cycles (although CAP aid is only paid with at least 5 different crops planted in any given year).  The program applies to all arable crops on the farm, with the exception of permanent or temporary meadows and pastures.\nThe allocation of the CAP aid is subject to compliance with the following conditions:\nAt least five different arable crops must be grown during a crop year (as part of the crop rotation programme)\nThe minimum area per crop shall not be less than 10 per cent of the total area of arable crops on the farm\nThe share of maize cannot exceed 30 percent\nThe same crop cannot be grown more than twice on the same field during the commitment period (5 years)\nThe conversion of permanent pastures and pasture to arable land is forbidden on the whole farm area\nThe annual aid per hectare is:\n- 100\u20ac if total surface of arable land on the farm is less than 50 hectares\n- 75\u20ac if total surface of arable land on the farm is between 50 and 100 hectares\n- 60\u20ac if total surface of arable land on the farm is above 100 hectares.\nUtilised agricultural area (UAA) in Luxembourg is composed to \u003E50% of permanent grassland (due to pedologic and topographic reasons); more than 70% of UAA is used for fodder production. The fodder is used in cattle production (mainly dairy cows). In the past years the arable production concentrated very much on maize (=\u003Eeasy and reliable fodder plant) and winter wheat (=\u003E good economic results). On many farms, the rotation degrades to a 2 years rotation: maize \u2013 wheat, maize \u2013 wheat, \u2026 with negative impacts on the soil, problematic weeds, high inputs (fertilisers, pesticides, \u2026). The aim of the CAP agri-environment-climate measure: Rotation program was to reverse this tendency and to give incentives to bring farmers back to longer rotations (at least 5 years). On a short perspective these are less profitable (and have to be financially compensated) but on a long-term view they have many ecological (and economic) benefits. The EFFO-Project (Effizienz durch Fortbildung = Efficiency by Edification) is a demonstration project, run on three pilot farms showing the advantages and practicability of longer rotations and helping thus to implement these in practice.\nBenefits of the CAP rotation program:\n- reduced land degradation and increased soil health by reduction of soil erosion\n- conservation of ecosystems\n- protection of water courses and therewith increasing water availability and quality\n- increased (bio)diversity by increasing plant and associated fauna diversity\n- reduced disaster risks (rainstorms, heatwaves, droughts) due to higher plant diversity and thus increased resilience\n- increased crop and fodder quality\nStrengths of the technology according to the users:\n- higher resilience of the cropping system\n- advantage of receiving CAP payments\n- positive impact on soil structure and (bio) diversity\n- positive impact on (drinking) water quantity and quality\nDisadvantages of the technology:\n- increased administrative burden\n- increased planning of crop rotations needed (more complicated to organise)\nThe compilation of this SLM is a part of the European Interreg project FABulous Farmers which aims to reduce the reliance on external inputs by encouraging the use of methods and interventions that increase the farm\u2019s Functional AgroBiodiversity (FAB).

Rural communities normally bake bread at home using tandoors made from clay and fired by shrubs, wood and coal. Bread baking is a demanding task. Men and boys climb mountains to collect shrubs, putting themselves at risk, and women spend 1-2 hours\/day for preparing dough, firing the oven and baking bread.  Shrub cutting causes upland degradation leading to flash floods in the valleys.\nIn Saighan, district adjoining Kahmard, a survey showed that one household uses 81 donkey load shrubs annually, and minimum 50 donkey loads are used for baking bread. Kahmard has a similar situation. To address this, HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation is supporting an integrated watershed management in Kahmard since 2008 with support from the Swiss Re and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). The approach comprises other technological and organisational measures where structural and vegetative are applied, combined with grazing and shrub cutting control. To complement re-greening efforts, energy efficient community bakeries were promoted.\nHouseholds using community bakeries reported a decrease in shrub consumption by 50-80%, which contributes to greener watersheds. The other benefits include more time for women, boys and girls for other preferred activities, like attending school, literacy classes, vocational trainings, embroidery, etc. Families also save money (minimum US$ 10\/month) as they have to purchase less shrubs for baking purpose. In Kahmard, one donkey load shrub costs about US$ 6. Bakers, assistant bakers, masons and workers are employed and bakeries serve as a place for social networking. By contributing to greener watersheds, the bakeries help to reduce flash flood risks. In recent months, running the bakeries has become a challenge as the coal mines in Kahmard have been contracted to a Chinese firm. As a consequence, people are not getting coal easily. Due to coal shortages, several bakeries have stopped functioning. People are looking towards the government authorities to solve this issue as soon as possible. Many households have gone back to shrub cutting and a community assets with proven benefits for the people but environment remains underutilized.\nThe participating community development councils or CDCs allocate land for bakery. One bakery costs about US$ 4640, with 25% community contribution during construction. It takes about 5 weeks for constructing one bakery if there are no obstacles. About US$ 7300\/year is spent on operation and maintenance by the people. One baker and 1-2 assistants are employed for daily bakery operations. The dash or oven is prepared from a mixture of clay and sheep hair and fired by coal. About 1-3 bags are required per day. If mosaic tiles are used, about 1 bag per day is used for heating. The factors influencing the success of community bakeries include access to coal, good quality and low price of coal, on time payment and proper management of bakery funds. The clients bring dough from home and pay about US$ 0.042 (2 Afghani) per bread to the baker or about US$ 6.6\/month.\nCommunity bakeries were constructed in the Kahmard district in the valley bottoms where the people reside. The land for community bakeries normally belongs to the community, but where suitable common land is not available, individuals have also donated their private lands for the common cause.\nCommunity bakeries are located at an altitude of about 1700-1800 m above mean sea level. The district receives up to 400 mm rainfall in a good year. In the valley bottom, there are crop growing seasons, the main is from March to July. The land users rely mainly on agriculture for their livelihoods as employment opportunities in the district are very few. Kahmard district has a population density of about 30 person\/sq. km. About 50% of the rural population in Kahmard falls under poor category, 40% are medium rich and 10% rich.\nCOMMENTS:\nEach bakery has an area of about 58 sq. m, and 25 bakeries have been constructed so far in Kahmard district with HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation support and financial contributions from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Severe flash floods due to degradation of upland watersheds as a result of overgrazing, shrub uprooting, ploughing and recurring droughts.

The three-tier institutional structure used in this eradication process involved the formation of informal women groups at the hamlet level (village organisational structure), the Village Environment Committee (VEC) at the village level, and an Executive Committee at the cluster level (higher organisational structure) so to ensure community involvement and ownership.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Santosh GuptaCommunity-based soil rehabilitation after the eradication of the invasive plant species, Lantana Camara, is an effective technique for restoring grasslands on common lands that had earlier been invaded by this species. The invasion of Lantana Camara can have significant negative impacts on the ecosystem, reducing the diversity of plant life and disrupting the local communities\u0027 use of common lands for grazing, for agriculture, and for collecting non-timber forest products.\nTo address these issues, a three-tier institutional structure is being used by the project-implementing organization Foundation for Ecological Security (FES). This structure includes the formation of informal women groups at the hamlet level, the Village Environment Committee (VEC) at the village level, and an executive committee at the cluster level. The VEC prepares proposals on common issues and plans with budgets that are presented to the executive committee, which is made up of a mix of individuals, with 50% of the seats reserved for women.\nThe first step in the process is for the village executive committee to take the Gram Sabha (Village Governing Body) into confidence and prepare bylaws for the restoration and conservation of the Lantana-eradicated site. These bylaws are regularly discussed in the village institution meeting to refresh the memory of the community and different stakeholders on how to properly conserve the site. Local resource persons facilitate the implementation of work.\nOne of the major works undertaken by these communities in the Mandla District is the soil rehabilitation from Lantana Camara for grassland restoration on common lands. The uprooting of Lantana is a tricky process, and improper methods can result in an even more forceful recurrence of the species. Therefore, the \u0022cut rootstock\u0022 method is used, which involves cutting the root of the plant three inches below the ground and lifting the bush upside down to prevent it from gaining ground. This method is done between July and September before fruiting to avoid seed fall, which can cause recurrence for up to three years, also this is the time when the soil has enough moisture thus softness to uproot the Lantana plants. \nThe Cut Rootstock (CRS) method to control the spread of Lantana Camara is cost-effective and sustainable as it does not require the use of chemical herbicides or heavy machinery. In addition to using the CRS method, perching trees are located, and saplings are removed from under their canopies and along the nearby surface runoff zone. Regular monitoring and follow-up actions may be necessary to ensure the long-term success of this method in controlling the spread of Lantana Camara.\nTo prevent a recurrence, measures such as mopping for three years continuously, planting and seed sowing in areas where rootstocks seem to be less, and grass seed sowing are executed. The community institution ensures the collection of indigenous grass species, which are made into seed balls and sown before the advent of monsoon. These grass seeds germinate and grow in the rainy season, reducing the suitable environment for Lantana seed germination. Revegetation measures involve selecting and planting grazing hardy, fire hardy, and water hardy tree species such as bamboo, Khameer, Java Plum, Karanj (Pongame oil tree), Aonla, Harra, and other non-timber forest product-producing tree species. These plants are selected to create a three-tiered forest and sustainably provide food, fuel wood, and fodder. Once established, they do not allow Lantana to grow.\nBiomass assessment is undertaken every year to assess the improvement in the status of the biomass in the plot, and the findings are shared with the community to motivate them to follow the rules and regulations formulated by the village institution. Cut and carry practices are allowed from the second year, but open grazing is prohibited, and Lantana eradication from nearby areas is required while cutting the grass. This helps to bring Lantana under control while sustainably utilizing the grass resources.\nThis initiative has ensured access to common lands for the local communities, access to fodder and green grass for livestock and the emergence of biodiversity in the area. This initiative is well recognised by Government institutions and policy makers.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe technology is applied on common lands viz. common grazing land, forest, Gram Panchayat landThe common land in villages which is generally not maintained, so allowing for the growth of invasive species, and unregulated open grazing is restored by the local community in a participatory manner for common benefits.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Institutional|Governance function|Inclusive decision-making processes in agriculture|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1116, 1129, 1131, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|forestry management|Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 921, 927, 897, 899, 1186, 918, 922","readiness_level":"7.

Families rely on their livestock not only for consumption of meat and dairy products, but also as means of transportation (donkeys), labour force in agriculture (oxen, donkeys) and a source of cash income. When crops fail to produce enough, families sell their livestock to survive until the next season.  Naturally, every family strives to increase their household\u2019s livestock as much as they can, which increases pressure on the local pastures, leading to extensive overgrazing.\nThe pastures in Jawaz Khana, Dashti Mirzai and Sari Joy are characterized by poor vegetation cover, low carrying capacity and severe erosion - with deep rills clearly visible.  The quantity and quality of fodder is insufficient for all the livestock, leading to poor animal health. Starting from early spring to late autumn livestock keepers graze their animals on the open grazing lands. During winter months, the animals are kept inside and fed with the fodder conserved during summer. Very often, and especially during droughts, the fodder stocks can be extremely low and inadequate for the animals to make it through to spring - and then farmers lose livestock.\nFor the purpose of tackling fodder shortages during winter months and preventing livestock loss, the Livelihood Improvement Project in Takhar (LIPT) supported the Natural Resources Management Committees in Sari Joy, Dashti Mirzai and Jawaz Khana to establish community fodder banks. The fodder bank is also meant to compensate for the closure of rehabilitated pastures during the exclusion period of 1-3 years. \nThe NRMC mobilized the community to construct the fodder bank building. The building is composed of a large single space of 3.5 m x 10 m x 4 m. Generally the location for the fodder bank is chosen in the middle of the village near the mosque or NRMC building. On average, the fodder bank has a capacity of 250 bags of straw and 50 bundles of hay. Durable construction materials, namely stone and cement are used for the walls. The walls are painted for protection from mould.  Proper windows and entrance door are installed to ensure insulation and protection from weather events. The construction materials and labour costs are fully covered by the LIPT project.  The maintenance works for the building consists of repairing the roof every autumn with a clay layer. \nThe fodder bank serves as a reserve for the village community. After each harvest the farmers deliver a certain amount of fodder to the fodder bank, and in return they can take out fodder for their livestock needs. The established regulations require that each farmer is obliged to reimburse the fodder bank for the fodder he has taken as a loan. The NRMC appoints persons in charge of accepting, and releasing, fodder from the fodder bank. The persons in charge record the incoming and outgoing fodder in the log book for fodder. The log book registers the name of the farmer and the amount of fodder he has delivered, or taken, from the fodder bank. \nThe fodder banks have been functioning for only couple of years. The community has been using the fodder bank to feed their livestock during winter mainly, but also when they have shortage of fodder in other months as well. Due to the low capacity of current pastures the farmers produce just enough to feed their livestock and not much is left to store in the fodder bank. The fodder stocks are expected to increase in future as part of the ongoing process of pasture rehabilitation through cultivation of alfalfa and rotational grazing plans. \nWomen and children are often involved in collecting the hay and carrying it to the fodder bank. This requires long-distance walks with heavy loads since many houses are located far from the fodder bank. Despite this heavy work, women say that they find the fodder banks useful because of the opportunity to borrow hay for their livestock when they need it.\nCOMMENTS:\nCoordinates of SLM plots owned by SLM implementers who participated in the FGD derived through the Rustaq NRM study QGIS database.\nThis documentation is based on the experiences of SLM implementers from Sari Joy (1 Fodder bank), Jawaz Khana, (1 Fodder bank), and Dashti Mirzai (1 Fodder bank).\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Institutional|Governance function|Partnerships|Social and socio-economic|Cooperative models and aggregation","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1116, 1129, 1135, 1076, 1077","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|livestock monitoring|animal health|Farm management|income increase|record-keeping and accounting|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|improving soil management practices|Collective action and aggregation|cooperative management to improve efficiency and governance","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 905, 907, 910, 1180, 911, 916, 918, 915, 921, 973, 974","readiness_level":"7.

Land use planning is one of the measures among others to contribute to support the integration of good Landscape and Sustainable Land Management (L-SLM) principles and practices into national policy and institutional framework to ensure the adoption of economically viable practices by rural communities. This technology is demonstrated in an application in Arkhiloskalo community in Eastern Georgia.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Hanns KirchmeirThe globally ongoing degradation of land resources is threatening our food security and functioning ecosystem services. Therefore, restoration of degraded land as defined by the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 15.3) has become a strategic objective of the UNCCD. To achieve Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), action on the national level is needed. Georgia is one of the 113 countries (as of Sept. 2017) willing to take part in the Target Setting Program (TSP).\nOne of the major problems which Georgia is facing today is an absence of a comprehensive and integrated approach in the land management sector. In addition, an irrelevant legal framework sometimes leads to additional \u201cconflicts\u201d with the evolved national strategy and policy packages.\nThe land-use planning in the village of Arkhiloskalo, Dedoplistskaro Municipality is one of the pilot activities linked to LDN (Land Degradation Neutrality). The project financed by  Global Environment Facility (GEF) \/ UN Environment Programm (UNEP) was implemented by  local partner REC Caucasus (The Regional Environmental Centre for the Caucasus) through E.C.O. Institute of Ecology (Austria).\nThe land-use plan documents the status quo of the current land use. It is a baseline that can be used to steer and monitor future developments. The land-use plan is based on field assessments made in summer 2019 and builds a baseline for future assessments\/monitoring. The land-use plan on the village level helps to break down national LDN targets to the local level. The plan and the development of land-use scenarios help to anticipate the future gains and losses of land resources and reflect the national LDN-target on the local level. Local stakeholders can identify areas of degradation risk and areas which can be rehabilitated. The Arkhiloskalo land-use plan contributes to sustainable land use by recognizing the current situation of land use and its spatial distribution as well as identifying the strength and weaknesses of the current situation.\nMethodology:\nMapping for Arkhiloskalo land use plan: The mapping result is a detailed documentation of size and spatial distribution of land cover categories. Change in land cover is an important indicator to monitor the loss and gains of land resources according to the LDN monitoring concept.\nFor the mapping of the settlements, arable land and gardens, maps from Google Earth and digital cadastre of parcels were used. In the field maps, each polygon has an assigned Map-ID number, which is unique for each village. Polygons with the same land use category and land-use intensity can have the same Map-ID. Next to the drawing of the polygon on the map, in a field form each polygon is described by:\n- Map-ID;\n- Current Land use category;\n- Current Land-use intensity;\n- Remark (a specification of the polygon if needed). \nClassifications of land use categories: The land-use classification is based on the CLC - Corine Land Classification System (The CORINE Land Cover is a vector map with a scale of 1:10 000, a minimum cartographic unit (MCU) of 100 m\u00b2. It maps homogeneous landscape patterns). The Corine Land Classification system classifies urban fabric, mine, dump and construction sites, arable land, permanent crops, pastures, forests, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation associations, Open spaces with little or no vegetation, inland wetlands and waters.\nThe pastureland was differentiated into different productivity classes. In the field three classes of vegetation cover and species composition: low, medium, and high productivity were assessed.\nFor the mapping in Arkhiloskalo the following land use categories were selected:   Settlements and human infrastructure (Code from the Corine Land Classification system \u2013 e.g. SHR, name \u2013 e.g. Houses); Forests and shrub-land; Agricultural managed land; Natural and semi-natural habitats.\nCOMMENTS:\nThe village Arkhiloskalo covers an area of 4,970 ha. The area ranges from the lower section in the North 250 m (Alasani river valley) up to 730 m at the ridge and then falls again to the South in the Shiraki Valley to 600 m.All form of land cover and land use forms have been mapped.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies|Geospatial technologies|GIS|Remote sensing","type_id":"993, 1015, 1052, 1027, 1034","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity mapping to inform land use planning|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|Governance, policy support and intelligence|SDG monitoring to track progress|Farm management|field management","use_cases_id":"916, 924, 917, 921, 918, 980, 981, 910, 914","readiness_level":"7.

Plants are taken to the plantation (microbasin) through different means of transportation (on foot, mule or, whenever possible, automobiles) during the early hours of the day or in the afternoon to avoid harsh sunlight. Holes are dug with manual excavator. The plants are placed according to the purpose of the plantation. In the case of microbasins\/conservation areas, plants are placed at a distance of 8x8 meters to 10x10 meters. The polyethylene bag is removed and the tree is placed in the hole with the substratum. The weather conditions and the soil conditions in the intervention site require no further measures such as irrigation or fertilizers.

The Impacts of the hydrometereological hazards are intensifed by unsustainable use of natural resources practices that promote rampant forest fires, soil and water degradation and erosion. Rural communities\u0027 health is precarious.\n\u0022Resiliencia\u0022 (Resilience) is a project undertaken by the Honduran\/Swiss Red Cross. It intends to provide sustainable contributions to enhance resilience in the rural regions of Olancho by combining the efforts to reduce risks posed by hazards (RHR) and those aimed at promoting health at all levels (home, community, municipality). By improving and ensuring the care of drinking water systems and providing training to manage water, wastewater and health practices, the project looks to establish for synergies between RHR and health. Though the communities already have water facilities, these are frequently old and prone to failure. The project provides communities technical and financial support to repair and improve their water system, starting from the water outlet, the water tank and the piping that extends to houses. Risk reduction is addressed throughout the entire process, Water infrastructure is protected through different measures that are defined through assessment of the state of the water system. The water tanks are improved whenever necessary, i.e. its interiors are repaired with ceramic and coating; further, the outer parts are coated and fissures are repaired. In most cases, the piping has to be changed with more resistant material (PVC is replaced with galvanized iron) to avoid fissures along the conduction line. The valves are repaired and hypochlorinators are installed. Vegetative measures - such as planting trees and shrubbery to stabilize soil and retain water - are implemented around the tanks and water outlets. These plant-based measures around the tank reduce risks of landslides; also, planting trees in the microbasin helps ensuring water provision in the quantities and quality required (for more information, see T 750). Finally, management measures are executed to reduce the risk of pollution. These measures involve, for example, ensuring strict protection of the water outlet and the water tank with a surrounding fence.\nMaintenance activities include constant supervision of the pipes and cleaning of the tanks (these are emptied, cleaned with chloride and then refilled) every 8 days (in winter) and every 15 days (in the summer) by the Water Board.\nCOMMENTS:\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Flood mitigation strategies","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1204","use_cases":"Farm management|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"910, 1154, 916, 920, 918, 921, 917","readiness_level":"7.

CSBs bridge traditional agricultural knowledge with evolving best practices, ensuring the continuity of seed diversity adapted to local conditions.\nA key function of CSBs is seed preservation and exchange. They provide for the collection of seeds from farmers, prioritizing varieties that have demonstrated superior local adaptation. Seeds are carefully cleaned, dried, and tested for viability before being stored\u2014typically in clay pots in a simple building. The preserved seeds can be used in future planting seasons or distributed during droughts, floods, or pest outbreaks, thereby ensuring timely access to reliable seed material.\nA CBS conserves and manages a diverse range of locally important crops including both cereals (sorghum and maize) and legumes (black grams, chickpeas, cowpeas, green grams, green peas, groundnuts, horse grams, red grams, and soybeans). Several traditional and improved cultivars of each crop are stored, selected on their performance under local conditions, including drought tolerance, pest and disease resistance, yield stability, and cultural preference. The quantity of seeds stored per cultivar ranges from 500 grams to 100 kilograms, depending on availability and community demand. For seed protection, both indigenous practices and materials such as wood ash, neem leaves (Azadirachta indica), and chili extract (Capsicum frutescens) are used to prevent pest infestation during storage, minimizing reliance on commercial pesticides.\nManagement of CSBs is local and participatory. They are generally governed by elected community committees that set the rules for deposit, withdrawal and replenishment. This governance structure ensures that the seed bank reflects the specific needs and knowledge systems of the community. Community engagement is not only vital for operational success but also fosters a sense of ownership and collective responsibility.\nCSBs play a multifaceted role. They contribute to agrobiodiversity conservation by safeguarding traditional and wild crop varieties, which are invaluable for future breeding programs. Furthermore, they ensure that farmers can access seeds during critical periods. Additionally, CSBs promote sustainable agricultural practices by reducing reliance on commercial seed systems. They also help to document and share traditional farming knowledge.\nThe operational structure of a CSB begins with community mobilization and capacity-building focused on seed selection, handling, and storage. Infrastructure requirements are modest. Maintenance involves tasks such as viability testing to ensure the germination potential of stored seeds.\nCSBs enhance the resilience of agricultural systems by enabling communities to recover swiftly from crop failures: they also reduce input costs. Furthermore, CSBs empower communities\u2014particularly smallholder farmers and women. Moreover, these banks store vital genetic material for future research.\nFrom a community perspective, the benefits are substantial. However, challenges remain. High initial investments in infrastructure and training are required, and ongoing success depends on strong community engagement and diligent record-keeping. Nevertheless, by preserving the genetic heritage of crops and empowering local communities, CSBs reduce contribute to food sovereignty\nCOMMENTS:\nThis documentation covers a single CSB located at Kumbharwadi village.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement|Community seed banks","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206, 1076, 1091, 1094","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|minimize pesticide use|Farm management|disaster management|improved plant varieties|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|improving soil management practices|Access to knowledge and advisory|access to agricultural advice|agricultural skills development|Collective action and aggregation|cooperative management to improve efficiency and governance","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 918, 926, 910, 1154, 902, 912, 921, 965, 967, 968, 973, 974","readiness_level":"7.

The technology is also supported by communal management plans, which were created to address the root causes of land degradation.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Nicholas Euan SharpeThis technology was developed and implemented through the RETESA Project \u201cLand rehabilitation and rangelands management in smallholder agropastoral production systems in south-western Angola\u201d. RETESA is a project owned and implemented by the Ministry of Environment of the Government of Angola, with technical and methodological assistance from The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).\nInappropriate grazing regimes and poor livestock management by pastoral communities in SW Angola have led to degradation of rangeland and pastoral resources, with perennial grassland species and shrubs having been effectively eliminated. This is despite the fact that the pastoral communities of the area know their environment extremely well and are aware of the land degradation happening around them. Under the project they identified crucial areas for rehabilitation works, selecting mostly areas around water points that have been in use both by local and transhumant herders. Through these works, the local community sought to (a) increase ground cover to reduce sediment loads entering waterways (erosion control), (b) provide shade for livestock, (c) increase forage production and (d) introduce legumes and multipurpose forage trees in areas of high animal traffic. A total of four areas in the Bibala and Virei Municipalities were identified for the activities.\nThe communities were closely involved in the selection and propagation of plant species for the rehabilitation works. The project field staff also ran field palatability trials with them to confirm that the plants selected met their expectations. These participatory trials were also aimed at enhancing their understanding of livestock nutrition and how it related to animal health. Once the species were chosen, seed was collected by the communities and the Project Technicians, and was multiplied in 32 Agro-Pastoral Field School Nurseries and 2 Government funded Veterinary Research Stations. A total of 15 species were identified, with the grasses Eragrostis superba, Urochloa mosambicensis, and the trees Acacia nilotica, Faidherbia albida, Leucaena leucocephala and Moringa oleifera being the most valued by the communities as forage and multipurpose species. The trees were germinated from seed with success. However, native grass species failed to germinate by standard methods - early field trials having ruled out direct seeding methods. Thus they were multiplied by root division of plants collected from cultivated fields.  This avoided removal of grass from natural areas.\nAs the majority of the areas selected for the rehabilitation works were focused around water points and waterways, the soils were generally alluvial, sandy loams. Precipitation is highest in the areas to the north: it ranges from 600 mm in the upper areas of the Bibala Municipality to 200 mm in the areas to the south in Virei. In general, the vegetation communities could be described as dry sclerophyll woodlands with Colophospermum mopane being the dominant tree species, with forest cover decreasing in height and density as one moves south toward drier areas.\nThrough close collaboration with the participant communities, three rehabilitation methods were designed and improved upon throughout the Project\u0027s duration. Method 1 was used to plant open areas within the rehabilitation zone, Method 2 was employed to introduce and protect concentrated plantings of the selected species in strategic locations within the landscape, and Method 3 was preferred for the recuperation of riparian vegetation and to reduce sediment loads in waterways. The three methods used are described in more detail in the Technical Drawings. To increase the sense of ownership and thus  the sustained effectiveness of the rehabilitation works, land management plans and other supporting activities were also carried out.\nCOMMENTS:\nThere are 3 main rehabilitation areas, all within the Namibe Province in Southern Angola.\nPlanting areas are selected due to their importance and relevance to the local communities. For the most part, the plantings have been centred around key water points. In order to increase impact and scale up the process of rangeland rehabilitation and improvement, management plans are negotiated and agreed upon by the communities through the Green Negotiated Territorial Development Approach (GreeNTD) processes.Number of growing seasons per year: 1\nLivestock density: Official data is not available and true livestock numbers are unknown.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Native species utilization|Traditional and indigenous practices|Institutional|Capacity development function|Farmer field schools|Governance function|Inclusive decision-making processes in agriculture|Partnerships|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1201, 1206, 1116, 1126, 1125, 1129, 1131, 1135, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|climate change adaptation|optimization of resource use for better production|animal health","use_cases_id":"897, 1186, 899, 916, 921, 917, 920, 910, 914, 918, 909, 907","readiness_level":"7.

Villaconzoilo was started by the barangay captain Mr. Alex  O. Aborita wherein parcels of lands were acquired for the association to utilize. He organized the Villaconzoilo farmers\u2019 group also known as the Compact Farming Agriculture Cooperative where he introduced new technologies to improve the farming system of the community. Farmers cultivate vegetable on a contract growing scheme. Some of the farm practices consist of growing vegetables and fruits using indigenous organic materials as soil conditioner and livestock raising. Vegetables and fruits are cultivated in divided parts but in the same area.\nPurpose of the Technology: Compact farming was organized to enhance group interactions and leadership among members of the association.The aim of the landusers in growing organic vegetables is to revive and sustain soil fertility and maximize waste management practice. Marigold was also planted in between plots within the farm to prevent and control insect and pest manifestation. Landusers in the barangay were empowered through farming and conservation of the forest area. Through this technology, marketability and available markets for the produced commodities were increased. The association received numerous award in the regional and provincial level because of their demonstration of a productive and profitable farming system in the upland area.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: It started in 2011 with 18 farmers investing 1000 pesos (22 dollars) each to buy initial inputs such as land, seeds and fertilizer. The area was cleared for agricultural activities. Produced are high value crops such as tomatoes, lettuce, pechay, cabbage, carrots, beans, broccoli, cucumber, and radish. These are sold not only in Jaro but also in the neighbouring municipalities and big markets in Leyte. The barangay was dubbed as the \u201cVegetable Basket\u201d and the \u201cWatermelon Queen\u201d because of their production. Activities in the farm such as plowing, harrowing, establishment of plots, fertilizer application, transplanting, watering, spraying and harvesting are done in a rotational basis among members of the association.\nNatural \/ human environment: Most of the farmers cultivated one parcel with size ranging from 1000-2000 square meters. Land ownership and land use right is communal. The farm production is managed by the cooperative composed of small scale land users. Members of the association are enganged in off-farm activities such as hunting and hired labor for additional income. The municipality of Jaro, Leyte has a type A modified climatic classification with an average monthly rainfall of 1000 to 1500 mm. Typhoons that usually come in October or November is very destructive to any standing crop. These factors discourage farmers to apply external inputs like fertilizer.

It is produced by mixing organic components (in this case study cow manure, rice straw, different leaves and ash) which are locally available. The ideal mix of ingredients shows an N-to-C ratio of approximately 1 to 25. By adding compost to the topsoil, its humus content is increased, and therefore the soil fertility and water holding capacity are enhanced. Although the technology can be applied with little technological knowledge, the land user\u2019s workload is augmented. This can be detrimental in a human environment with constantly decreasing available labour force.\nThe purposes of compost production are multifaceted. From the land user\u2019s point of view, the increased yields are certainly one of the most determining factors. This is due to the augmentation of organic matter and nutrients in the topsoil which results in a higher soil fertility. Therefore, the use of chemical fertilizer can be diminished while the yields stay the same. This results in the amelioration of the land user\u2019s livelihood, since he needs to buy less fertilizer. Also, the improved soil structure (according to the land user, the soil is softer and easier to cultivate) and water retention capacity are of importance in this area, since the soils are sandy\/loamy, and due to climate change the rainfall is more erratic and droughts more recurrent. Compost also buffers the soil\u2019s pH and prevents acidification. As a consequence, the nutrient availability is increased. Finally, compost adds more biota to the soil.\nFirst, the compost house is built. This can be done either with external inputs such as bricks, cement, and a tin roof (the initial investment is higher, but the recurrent maintenance activities lower), or with locally available, natural inputs such as rice straw and clay for the walls and dried sugar palm leaves for the roof (the initial investment is lower, however there are more recurrent maintenance activities which can be detrimental for the continuation of compost production).\nOnce the compost house is built, the organic matter (approximately 70 % cow manure, and 30 % rice straw and different leaves, with a small amount of ash) is collected in the surroundings and carried to the compost house. In this case study, compost is produced once during the dry season and once during the wet season. During the dry season, water is added to the organic matter in order to facilitate the composting process. Ideally, the organic matter should be turned in order to guarantee a complete composting process. However, this includes a rather big workload. As a result, turning is not always practiced in the area (high migration rates result in a decrease of available labour force).\nWhen the composting process is completed, the compost is carried to the fields with the use of animal traction. This is done several times: once when the fields are plowed, once when the rice seedlings are transplanted and once while the rice is growing (\u201ctop dressing\u201d).\nThe analyzed area is flat (slope \u003C 2%), with a tropical climate with a (dry and a wet season), and the soils are mostly sandy or loamy. The soils have a low fertility, contain little organic matter, the pH is sinking, the area has been deforested a long time ago and the groundwater table is rather high (1-2 m during the dry season, on the surface during wet season).\nDue to climate change, land users notice more erratic rainfalls, temperatures rise and more recurrent droughts. Rice is the predominant crop grown in the area, since it serves as staple food (mix subsistence and commercial activities). Rice is often grown in monocultures and harvested once a year. Once the rice is harvested (dry season), the cattle are released to the paddy fields. \nAs an addition to rice, most land users grow vegetable and fruits in small home gardens (subsistence) and complement their income by producing handicrafts or through off farm income \/ remittances from family members working in other places. The increasing migration rate (the young generation leaves the villages to work in the cities, garment industry or abroad) results in a decrease of available labour force in the area. This has detrimental effects on the agricultural activities. Furthermore, the civil war in the 1970s (Khmer Rouge) led to the loss of agricultural knowledge.\nCOMMENTS:\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Lack of organic matter, lack of water retention in soil, irregularity of rainfall, low soil fertility (sandy soil), monocultures, bare soil during dry season, ploughing.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Rice field: lack of nutrients, need fertilizer and compost otherwise no good yield. Not enough compost available, need to use also small amount of chemical fertilizer even though compost is applied. Lack of water. Soil erosion.\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Farm management|income increase|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 918, 922, 910, 1180, 909","readiness_level":"7.

It involves breaking organic matter down into humus\/ compost by aerobic microorganisms - with by-products of water, heat, ammonia (NH3), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Humus is a dark and crumbly natural form of fertilizer applied to the soil to improve crop production. Composting is cost-effective since it can be made from locally available materials such as leaves, plant residues, food remains, cow dung, poultry droppings, animal urine, soil, etc. Composting is thus an on-farm solid waste management measure. When made correctly it can improve carbon sequestration in the soil (compost is carbon-rich) and prevent methane emissions (a greenhouse gas) since methane-producing microbes become inactive in aerobic conditions (in the presence of oxygen).\nThere are many ways of preparing compost. This method involves three key stages; mixing brown organic materials, such as twigs, and green materials, such as fresh leaves that are nitrogen-rich and moist. In the first stage, brown and green materials are layered, beginning with a 30 cm layer of twigs at the bottom, followed by a 30 cm layer of dry matter, such as maize straw chopped to a maximum of 7.5 cm. This is followed by a 30 cm layer of dry grass and dry leaves covered by a 7.5 cm \u2013 15 cm layer of fresh cow dung. The fresh cow dung is covered by a 15 cm layer of fresh tithonia (an exotic plant) that is completely covered by a layer of ash and sprayed uniformly using 10 litres of animal urine and finally completely covered by a layer of soil or manure. All the above inputs except urine are sprayed with 10 \u2013 20 litres of water. The pile is then completely covered with a black polythene sheet to help absorb heat, prevent the entry of rainwater, and prevent volatilization of nitrogen, i.e., the conversion of ammonium into ammonia gas, and left to decompose for 21 to 30 days.\nThe second stage involves mixing and transferring all the material except the twigs, to another space. The heap is again completely covered with a black polythene sheet to help absorb heat, prevent rainwater entry, and prevent nitrogen volatilization. It is again left to decompose for another 21 to 30 days. The third stage, like the second stage, involves completely mixing and transferring all the material from the second stage to another space and completely covering the heap with a black polythene sheet to help absorb heat and prevent the entry of rainwater. The contents are allowed to decompose for another 21 to 30 days, after which they are ready-to-use compost. The compost is stored under shade and covered with a black polythene sheet again to prevent nitrogen volatilization.\nOne heap of compost (first stage: 1.5 m by 1.5 m by 1.5 m) produces about 5 tonnes of ready-to-use compost. Composting takes about 90 days; hence, provided that all inputs are available, a farmer can produce compost 4 times each year from the same heaping point, i.e., about 20 tonnes. Normally, a 0.4-hectare farm requires about 20 tonnes of this compost. However, the amount varies from farm to farm depending on the conditions of the soil and the crop(s) to be grown. It is important that soil testing is done to determine the conditions of the soil to ensure that the compost is being used in the most effective manner.\nCompost is carried to the farm on wheelbarrows and in buckets and is applied at the farm during planting time where a handful of compost is applied in the planting hole and mixed with soil before planting. It is again applied around the base of the crop and completely covered with soil. Preparation of compost in conservation agriculture situations could pose the problem of competition for plant material since plant material is used in conservation agriculture to cover the soil. To manage this, a farmer implementing both composting and conservation agriculture may have to acquire plant material for composting from other sources such as purchasing stover from other farmer who are not implementing conservation agriculture.

The aim is to improve soil fertility, increase agricultural production and household income. The technology makes nutrients more readily available to plants in a short period of time through composting. During composting, raw organic matter is transformed into stable humus which is absorbed by plants thus enabling increased production.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Sarah BabiryeCompost manure application is an integrated pest, disease and soil fertility management technology that cheaply avails organic matter to increase crop\/land productivity among local farmers. Farmers use locally available inputs like weeds, kitchen refuse, crop residues (maize, sorghum, millet, wheat among others) at less or no cost. These nutrients are thus made available to plants through transforming raw organic matter into stable humus, which is readily absorbed by plants. This increases agricultural and vegetable production. However, the nitrogen content in the compost can be further increased if waste plant materials such as Lantana Camara, Sesbania are integrated. Procedures to make compost manure include the following steps:\n\u2022 Digging pits of about 2m length, 2 m width and 0.75 m depth.\n\u2022 Placing the assorted organic materials in pit no. 1 and covering it with soil in a dome shape to prevent water from seeping into the decomposing materials. Residues so assembled should be in their raw form collected from either the kitchen, weeds from gardens, peelings and crop residues like maize and sugarcane husks. As a rule of thumb, the compost pile should be build by beginning with a bottom layer of bigger sized materials, such as maize stovers, of about 15cm height. This should also include a layer of dry vegetation, hedge or grass cuttings to about 15cm height. Sprinkling top soil and adding water by using a watering can will to moisten the whole layer. In this pit, the degradation process will take a period of 1-2 months.\n\u2022 In the third month, the materials are then transferred to pit no. 2, arranged and compressed in layers and covered with soil in a dome shaped manner.\n\u2022 After another spell of 4-5 months, these decomposed materials are then transferred to pit no. 3. This comprises of decomposed matter ready for use. In this last pit, manure in the final stage is always cold, dark and most importantly, less bulky. It produces a pleasant smell when spread.\nIn case of a banana plantation, ready compost is applied around the banana hills or in trenches between 4 banana plants. Soils with compost cannot easily be washed away by water or blown by wind as the soil particles are held tightly together with the sticky substance secreted in the process of decomposition. This glue-like structure also helps to hold moisture in the soil hence improving the structure.\nThe farmer selects a suitable and convenient place for the compost pit system preferably near the garden and home stead where he digs three pits. The cost of digging a compost pit depends on where the pits are to be located. If the place is easy to dig, each pit costs about UGX 5,000\/=. Other costs include, hiring a spade at UGX 1,000\/=, a hoe at UGX 1,000\/=, a pan at UGX 1,000\/= and a watering can at UGX 1,000\/=, all summing up to UGX 9000\/= for the whole activity. The technology improves production in both annual and perennial plants such as fodder grasses and crops through restoring degraded soils by improving soil structure, soil moisture and micro organism content. As the technology provides nutrients to plants it also reduces environmental pollution associated with inorganic fertilizer use. Nutrients are released gradually, enabling the following year\u2019s crops to benefit as well. Weeding is done easily in areas applied with compost manure as the soil has a soft texture. Through this technology, home hygiene is improved by utilising wastes. Plant diseases and pests like banana weevils are suppressed.\nHowever, making compost manure is challenging. It requires a lot of commitment and serious efforts to collect the kitchen and garden residues all the time. Digging a pit is quite laborious and farmers with little land find it hard to reserve land for compost pits.\nThis technology is an agronomic measure that helps in waste management through recycling, re-use or reduction of wastes, thereby improving sustainable land management. Maintenance is always by ensuring that compost pits are not under permanent shade and properly covered. Pits should be emptied after the process is done in preparation for the next cycle.\nCOMMENTS:\nCoordinate points  where the technology was captured were E 03017319 (Longitude) and Latitude N 004014.4\nSOURCES:\n\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206, 1198, 1197","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|minimize pesticide use|plant health|optimization of resource use for better production|climate change mitigation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 917, 922, 926, 906, 909, 919","readiness_level":"7.

During November and December layers of chopped crop residues, animal dung and ash are heaped, as they become available, up to 1.5 m high and watered. The pile is covered with straw and left to heat up and decompose. After around 15-20 days the compost is turned over into a second pile and watered again. This is repeated up to three times - as long as water is available. Compost heaps are usually located close to the homestead. Alternatively, compost can be produced in pits which are up to one metre deep. Organic material is filled to ground level. The pit captures rain water, which makes this method of composting\na valuable option in dry areas.\nThe compost is either applied immediately to irrigated gardens, or kept in a dry shaded place for the next sorghum seeding. In the latter case one handful of compost is mixed with loose soil in each planting pit (zai). These pits are dug 60 cm by 60 cm apart. Three to four grains of sorghum are planted in each pit. Compost in the pits both conserves water and supplies nutrients. This enables the sorghum plants to establish better, grow faster and reach maturity before the rains finish. As compost is applied locally to the crop, not only is the positive effect maximised, but also the weeds between the pits do not benefit. The water retaining capacity of the compost (absorbing several times its own weight) makes the difference. This is much more important than the additional nutrients, which only become available in subsequent years, and do not anyway completely replace all the nutrients extracted by the crops.\nThe planting pits also help by harvesting runoff water from the microcatchments between them. Boulgou experiences erratic and variable rainfall with frequent droughts. The poor soils are often crusted and have a low water-retention capacity. Due to a high and increasing population, the land has become exhausted, and fallow periods are no longer sufficient as a consequence. Fertility and yields have declined. Sorghum without compost is more vulnerable to drought and crop failure.\nDuring the dry season, after harvest, fields are grazed by cattle of the nomadic pastoral Peuhl, who also herd the agriculturalists\u2019 livestock. Interestingly, the Peuhl have started to systematically collect the manure for sale, since the increased demand (for composting) has led to doubling of the price. Composting has been applied in Boulgou Province of Burkina Faso since 1988.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 200 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Population increase has led to cultivation of all the available arable land, thus shortening or eliminating fallow periods.\nOrganic matter in the soil is reduced, the water holding capacity of the soil has diminished and consequently yields have fallen. This has been compounded by the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s. Thirty years ago farmers harvested 800 kg\/ha each year, but by the 1980s yields had fallen to merely 400 kg\/ha on average.\nMain products\/ services: Sorghum and zebu cattle (after harvest)SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1203, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 922, 918, 920, 910, 914, 912, 1186, 899","readiness_level":"9.

Contract services offered by the joint venture means that 1,000 ha are now covered each year. The main winter crops are wheat, oats, and oilseed rape. Beans are sown in the spring. The heavy clay loam is vulnerable to excessive surface moisture, restricting crop establishment\n\u2018windows\u2019.\nImmediately after harvest the soil is loosened and straw incorporated, and then soil is consolidated (using a \u2018cultivation train\u2019 combining two machines: the \u2018Simba Solo\u2019 and the \u2018Cultipress\u2019). This encourages up to 60% of the weeds to emerge in a \u2018stale seedbed\u2019. Spraying then removes all the weeds and volunteer plants of previous crops. This is followed by a light surface tillage, using the \u2018V\u00e4derstad Rapid Cultivator Drill\u2019, before sowing into the seedbed created. Equipment comprises implements with tines and\/or discs which create a tilth to around 10 cm\nwithout inverting the soil. Cambridge rollers are then used to consolidate the sown land. After crop maturity, combine harvesting takes place - with simultaneous chopping of straw\/crop residues. A trash rake is used to disperse the chopped straw. This way excessive trash is incorporated rapidly into the soil. Compaction may arise in the transition phase, because of the lack of soil loosening through ploughing: minimising traffic, keeping to tramlines and headlands can all help. In time, increases in soil organic matter content and earthworm biomass make compaction less of a problem. The problem of slugs can be reduced by improving seed-to-soil contact, and by drilling deeper.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of conservation agriculture is cost effective, timely and rapid crop establishment, under good soil conditions. High-speed operations are the key. Compared with conventional ploughing, labour is saved and fuel costs lowered. However, an additional application of herbicides represents an extra expenditure. Yields per hectare haven\u2019t risen but the key difference is that about four times as many hectares can be prepared in time for autumn planting under conservation tillage, thus improving overall production. Incorporation of crop residues improves soil structure and leads to a more friable, less erodible topsoil.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 10 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Traditional inversion tillage is slow and costly. By moving to high speed non-inversion conservation tillage farmers can\nspread costs over a larger area and maximise the area under winter crops. The speed at which ground can be worked in the autumn is critical: one month earlier planting can mean an extra ton in cereal yield.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Harvesting and processing equipment|Vehicles and machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1192, 1194","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|optimization of resource use for better production|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|equipment management|climate change mitigation|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 917, 921, 922, 909, 912, 913, 919, 926","readiness_level":"9.

CA has been promoted as an agri-environmental measure of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) by the Veneto region to extend sustainable land management. In spite of being provided by the regional government with subsidies, so far the adoption of  CA by the farmers has been very limited since its introduction, amounting less than 1% (ca. 2000 ha) of the total regional cropland area (mainly concentrated in the low Venetian plain).\nPurpose of the Technology: CA has been proposed to the farmers with the aim of reducing environmental impacts as well as economic and energetic inputs to the agricultural system. Compared with conventional practices such as soil ploughing, CA is convenient due to the saving of labour and fuel costs, with a direct effect in reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Limiting the soil disturbance and guaranteeing the continuous soil cover involve both a reduction of water runoff and surface erosion and an increase of soil biodiversity and fertility.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The main winter crops usually cultivated in the low Venetian plain are wheat, rapeseed and barley, while summer season crops are maize, soybean, sorghum. Generally CA consists of direct sowing on untilled soil using a double-disk opener planter for seed deposition, while after harvesting crop residues are chopped and dispersed to the surface in order to guarantee a mulching effect and a rapid incorporation into the soil. Since application of CA practices consider the permanent soil cover, the main crop is followed by cover crops that are usually graminaceae or brassicaceae. Cover crops are neither fertilized nor treated with pesticides during growing, while their final devitalisation is achieved with non-specific herbicides (e.g. Glyphosate, Glufosinate Ammonium).\nNatural \/ human environment: Advantages of adopting conservation agriculture have been widely demonstrated worldwide and can be classified in economic, agronomic and environmental benefits. From an environmental point of view, the soil system preserves its structure and biodiversity thanks to minimum soil disturbance to the root zone, microorganisms, fungi and macroinvertebrates. Greenhouse gas emissions under conservation agriculture compared to traditional cultivation systems are lower and might offset the gains obtained to mitigate global warming. Due to the recent introduction of the technology in the Veneto region (since mid-2000s), conservation agriculture has shown contrasting results in terms of crop yield since still in a transition period between conventional and conservation agriculture practices.COMMENTS:The main winter crops usually cultivated in the low Venetian plain are wheat, rapeseed and barley, while summer season crops are maize, soybean, sorghum.\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soils in the low Venetian plain of the Veneto region generally suffer from a loss of soil organic matter (SOM) that is strongly affected by their natural texture and climatic conditions. Moreover, in the last 50 years intensive tillage practices contributed to a further SOM decrease, estimated at 0.02-0.58 t\/ha\/y of carbon.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Decrease of productivity, soil compaction. To date, few farmers have adopted voluntarily conservation practices to reduce a decline of soil fertility and SOM content, symptom of poor perception of the problem. Moreover, the low technical know-how causes low yield performances and discouraged farmers to adopt the SLM technology.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact|Production|crop production|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 921, 922, 919, 925, 897, 898, 909, 910, 914, 912","readiness_level":"7.

Conventional \u0022arable\u0022 agriculture is normally based on soil tillage as the main operation. The technology is mainly practiced in the dry areas of Mbeere District where farmers experience very dry spells in most times of the year.\nPurpose of the Technology: Conservation agriculture (CA) aims to achieve sustainable and profitable agriculture and subsequently aimes at improved livelihoods of farmers through the application of the three CA principles: minimal soil disturbance, permanent soil cover and crop rotations. CA holds tremendous potential for all sizes of farms and agro-ecological systems, but its adoption is perhaps most urgently required by smallholder farmers, especially those facing acute labour shortages. It is a way to combine profitable agricultural production with environmental concerns and sustainability and it has been proven to work in a variety of agroecological zones and farming systems.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The first key principle in CA is practicing minimum mechanical soil disturbance which is essential to maintaining minerals within the soil, stopping erosion, and preventing water loss from occurring within the soil.The second key principle in CA is much like the first in dealing with protecting the soil. The principle of managing the top soil to create a permanent organic soil cover can allow for growth of organisms within the soil structure. This growth will break down the mulch that is left on the soil surface. The breaking down of this mulch will produce a high organic matter level which will act as a fertilizer for the soil surface.The third principle is the practice of crop rotation with more than two species.Crop rotation can also help build up soil infrastructure. Establishing crops in a rotation allows for an extensive buildup of rooting zones which will allow for better water infiltration.\nNatural \/ human environment: CA principles are universally applicable to all agricultural landscapes and land uses with locally adapted practices. CA enhances biodiversity and natural biological processes above and below the ground surface. Soil interventions such as mechanical soil disturbance are reduced to an absolute minimum or avoided, and external inputs such as agrochemicals and plant nutrients of mineral or organic origin are applied optimally and in ways and quantities that do not interfere with, or disrupt, the biological processes.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): High moisture loss from the soil due to evaporation\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Low crop production\nFuture (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Cropland: Ca: Annual cropping\nLivestock density: \u003C 1 LU\/km2SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Conservation practices|Nature-based solutions","type_id":"993, 1198, 1196","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|water use optimization for sustainability|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|income increase|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 921, 918, 919, 920, 909, 910, 1180, 914, 912","readiness_level":"7.

Negative components of this system are intensive tillage, returning little organic matter to the land and monoculture. This system has led to soil degradation (wind and water erosion), soil fertility loss, boost-up of diseases, weed infestation and other problems.\nConservation Agriculture (CA) involves removing these negative components of conventional farming systems and includes three basic principles: 1) minimal soil disturbance, 2) permanent soil cover with crop residues and 3) crop rotation.\nIn accordance with these principles, \nConservation Agriculture technology includes 3 main operations:\n1. Sowing with simultaneously soil fertilization using direct seeder.\n2. Post-sowing (after 1-2 days) treatment by non-selective herbicide\n3. Harvesting combined with simultaneous plant residues chopping and spreading\nFor comparison Conventional technology includes 7 operations:\n1.  Deep fall soil tillage (25 cm).\n2.

On each farm, field trials under equal conditions (soil, temperature, humidity, landscape, etc.) were conducted and included 2 treatments: Conventional (7 operations) and Conservation Agriculture (3 operations).\nAnalysis of 2002-2004 trials data demonstrated that yield of wheat and other cereals under CA technology was in average 15-25% higher in comparison with the conventional technology. The advantages of CA technology are especially evident in the years of drought (up to 40% in dry 2004 year). Economic evaluation of the technology made by two independent experts from Kazakhstan (Kazakh Research Institute for Grain Farming) and USA (Idaho State University) suggested that costs of labor, fuel, repairs and spare parts as well as machinery and equipment wearing-out under the Conservation Agriculture technologies is significantly lower as compared to those of traditional technology. In general, it is important to emphasize that the experience of the CA adaptation in North Kazakhstan helped farmers\/land-users:\n\u2022To determine the appropriate level of tillage in a cropping system that is feasible with direct sowing and CA technology requirements as a potential goal.\n\u2022To retain sufficient residue on the soil surface to reduce soil erosion, enhance crop\/water productivity, improve soil fertility (because of plant organic material bioprocessing in the soil) and better ensure long term, sustainable production.\n\u2022Employ economically viable, diversified crop rotations that can improve cropping system productivity and offer farmers new options to reduce risk that is  extremely important for the conditions of Northern Kazakhstan relating to the area of risk farming.\nThe  introduction of the technology for cereal production in the rainfed areas of Kazakhstan was realized within the framework of the FAO\/TCP\/KAZ\/2801 (T) Project \u201cConservation Agriculture for Sustainable Crop Production in Northern Kazakhstan\u201d, under active cooperation with counterparts: Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan (MoA RK), FAO, CIMMYT, Union of Farmers of Kazakhstan (UFK), national agriculture research organizations.COMMENTS:1) Farm \u201cCherezdanov\u201d, Smirnovo village, Akkayin district, Northern Kazakhstan region, located approximately 60 kilometers south of Petropavlovsk and 700 km from Astana (Nur-Sultan).

The soils are predominantly acidic and low in fertility, with the yields of food staples, such as maize and common bean averaging 1 ton\/ ha and 5 tons\/ ha, respectively. Consequently, the smallholder farmers have encroached into the adjacent Kakamega and Nandi forests in their quest for supplementary agro-ecosystem services and farm incomes. Degradation of the agro-resource base is underpinned by unsustainable practices carried out under conventional farming; for example, continuous cultivation with low nutrient inputs, mono-cropping, removal of crop residues and full tillage. Some of these practices enhance climate change by intensifying the emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Therefore, widespread adoption of conservation agriculture (CA) technology is being promoted to reduce the adverse impacts of conventional farming and enhance sustainable land management, environmental protection, and climate change mitigation and adaptation in 10 micro-catchments located within a 5-km radius from the edge of Kakamega and Nandi forests. The CA technology is characterized by the principles of minimum mechanical soil disturbance, maintenance of at least 30 percent permanent organic soil cover, diversified cropping through intercropping and crop rotations, and weed control. These principles have been adapted to the local conditions and needs.\nThe establishment of CA technology begins with land preparation. That is, the existing weeds and previous crop residues in the field are either slashed, or controlled through the application of appropriate herbicides. All the residues are retained on soil surface as opposed to burning, or removal in the conventional system. Land preparation is followed by planting, where the jab planter is used for precise placement of seeds and fertilizers in un-ploughed field, or within the established planting hills and rip lines to minimize soil tillage. This contrasts with conventional farming practice where a plough, or a hand hoe is used to till the entire field and establish the planting holes for placing seeds and fertilizers. A combination of cereal (maize \u2013 Zea mays L.) and legumes (common bean \u2013 Phaseolus vulgaris L., soybean - Glycine max, velvet bean \u2013 Mucuna pruriens and cowpea \u2013 Vigna unguiculata) are either intercropped, or rotated in the field each season to optimize the use of the available soil resources, including water, nutrients, and micro-organisms. The main cereal-legume association involves the establishment of Mucuna pruriens under maize as a dense cover crop. In this cropping system, Mucuna pruriens seeds are sown within a spacing of 1 m \u00d7 0.5 m where they grow and spread to completely cover the soil surface. As the cover crop grows, the leaves fall and decompose on the ground, enriching the soil\u2019s nutrients, organic matter and fertility. The maize - Mucuna pruriens mix is rotated with either sole common bean, soybean and cowpea crop, or an intercrop of maize with any of the legumes. Weeding is carried out using either selective herbicides, or weed scrapers. When designing the intercropping and rotation plans, crop families (N-fixing vs. non-fixing), root depths (shallow vs. deep roots), and susceptibility to diseases, pests and weeds are all considered.\nGenerally, CA technologies have multiple benefits for farmers and the environment. In the context of the Kakamega-Nandi forest landscape, the CA plots with Mucuna pruriens as a dense cover crop have shown improved soil organic matter, soil structure and nutrient status. It is expected that this will reduce the use of fertilizers over time. Most farmers have also reported that reduced tillage and direct placement of inputs (seeds and fertilizers) save them time, money, fuel, labour and inputs. Aside from saving resources, reduced tillage will ultimately enhance soil living organisms and mitigate atmospheric CO2 emissions through the decrease in fuel consumption and soil disturbance. Moreover, farmers have observed that the maize established with Mucuna pruriens as a cover crop remains green and healthy for long during mid-season dry spells compared to those under mono-culture, or light mulch. This implies that the CA technology also increases water infiltration and soil water content; thus, acting as insurance against drought. The increase in water infiltration and soil moisture occurs because the dense Mucuna pruriens cover crop not only regulates the soil surface temperatures and evaporation, but also reduces surface runoff and exposure to wind erosion. In addition, farmers have witnessed the suppression of weeds, such as Striga hermonthica (witchweed) in plots under dense cover crop and diversified cropping. Besides, diversified cropping through rotations has reduced the incidences of insect pests and diseases, as well as the risk of crop failure during extreme weather conditions and pest infestations. Specifically, farmers have noticed that the CA plots under maize - Mucuna pruriens intercrop are less affected by the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) compared to those under mono-culture. They have also noted that, in seasons of excessive rainfall, the maize intercropped with the common bean is usually harvested even when the common bean fails. Most importantly, these CA benefits have boosted maize yields by over 50 percent, meaning more food and income, and fewer forest encroachments. \nProper adoption of the CA technology by land users within the Kakamega-Nandi forest landscape is being hampered by several factors. Firstly, crop residues are inadequate due to competing uses, such as animal feed and fuel. At times, livestock is even allowed to graze on the stubble field, contravening the CA principles. Besides, some farmers have not fully embraced crop diversification and still grow maize throughout the seasons without rotation with other drought-tolerant cereals, such as sorghum and millet. Conventional ploughing is also quite entrenched. Further, some farmers still do not prefer Mucuna pruriens as a cover crop because of insufficient knowledge on the utilization of its inedible yields. Lastly, some farmers are finding it hard to access CA inputs and tools, such as the jab planters, weed scrapers, herbicides and seeds of Mucuna pruriens owing to either high prices, or shortages.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|optimization of resource use for better production|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|Farm management|field management|income increase|water use optimization for sustainability|forestry management|minimize pesticide use|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 918, 919, 921, 922, 909, 908, 910, 914, 1180, 920, 927, 926, 925","readiness_level":"7.

The documented CA focuses on a dryland mixed system, including a biennial rotation of legume and cereals with integrated livestock management.  CA has positive benefits on soil health and significantly reduces the needed inputs (e.g. fuel, labour) and workload for farmers.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Joren VerbistLand degradation leading to desertification is an increasingly important problem in the dry land regions of the globe. This does not only a\ufb00ect the bio-physical aspects such as carbon storage, but also the lives of local land users. Land degradation is often initiated by the lack of vegetation cover as is often a consequence of overgrazing and over-ploughing (i.e mismanagement). Furthermore, climate change leads to droughts, intensified rainfall events, increased temperature, and more extreme weather events. These compromised climatic conditions enhance land degradation. This leads to less fertile soils, reducing yields and consequently deteriorates the income and lives of local farmers. Taking the consequence and scale of degradation into account, natural resource conservation interventions are urgently required.\nAs the lack of soil cover is an, if not the, essential initiating factor in the desertification process, it should be maximally addressed. In the light of this, CA has been developed, based on three leading principles: i) minimizing soil disturbances or no-tillage, ii) maintaining a permanent soil cover with mulch, and iii) adequate crop rotations.  Overall, the three principles prevent land degradation and can also rehabilitate the land. This is because soil organic matter is maintained in\/on the soil and the erosive power of raindrops are broken by the soil cover. Therefore, CA aims for more sustainable resource use (land and water use) and to optimize climate-resilient and integrated crop-livestock systems to sustainably intensify production in fragile dry areas.\nTunisia is a country that experiences the previously described pattern and results of desertification and where smallholder farmers are largely dependent on livestock for income generation.  However, the livestock competes with the concept of CA as plant residues (stubble) are normally grazed by the livestock. Conservation agriculture propagates no or minimum soil disturbance\/ tillage. However, the purchase of a zero-tillage seeder machine appears to be a bottleneck  due to high costs since they are hardly produced locally. Nevertheless, there are farmers in the semi -arid areas of Tunisia, who adopted the technology and experience significant benefits such as increased soil fertility and over time increasing yields. In addition, as erosion rates are high in this rainfed area of 300 to 600 mm annual precipitation,  a well-covered soil will reduce runoff and loss of top soil. Since ploughing is restricted, the workload and the demanded fuel is reduced, resulting in decreased costs and labour with respect to the conventional practices. Furthermore, integrated crop-livestock is practiced by limiting livestock to graze  only the freshly harvested fields while producing manure to enhance soil health (organic fertilization and increase in soil organic matter).\nAdditionally, according to the third principle of CA, legumes were introduced in the agricultural system (crop rotation), besides the conventional cereal (e.g. durum wheat or barley). Specifically, faba bean is promising, as it has nitrogen fixing e\ufb00ects, enhancing soil health, and increasing and diversifying farm income. Vetch and other forage mixtures have also been successfully introduced to provide farmers with nutritious feed for livestock within the CA concept. In irrigated areas (e.g. parts in Algeria), the practice of CA has an additional benefit as it increases the irrigation water use e\ufb03ciency due to less evaporation and better infiltration.\nThe previous agro-pastoral farming practices changed under CA to an integrated crop-livestock system where soil cover is permanent. This mixed system consist of firstly weed control. Secondly, zero-tillage seeding is done directly into the soil even if covered with e.g. mulch\/stubble. Faba bean and\/or wheat are seeded and rotated yearly. This is beneficial as legumes fix nitrogen in the soil, lowering the amount of nitrogenous fertilizer needed. Thirdly, required fertilizers (for wheat additional nitrogenous fertilizer) is applied with a spreader. Fourthly, herbicides, pesticides, insecticides and fungicides are applied with a sprayer for disease control. Fifthly, the field is harvested with a combine. The stubble is then partly grazed by the sheep and goats until there remains a 1-2 cm residue layer i.e. mulch. For one hectare this accounts for a thirty day grazing period for thirty goats or sheep. This results in an integrated Crop-Livestock system under CA (CLCA), as the stubble provides feed for livestock while the livestock provides the soil with manure. \nThe land users that have adopted CA have indicated that they extremely appreciate the reduction in work, also the cost of labour and fuel, etc. In addition, they saw increased yields due to improved soil health. However, this beneficial impact could only be observed in the long-term since yields take time to increase, which can be considered as a weakness as the small holder farmer tends to prioritize short term profits. Another weakness is that the livestock is constrained since residues ought to remain on the field.\nIn conclusion, even though there are bottlenecks, the technology of conservation agriculture is a solution to combat desertification while improving the lives of local land users through the process.\nInformation and data presented is partly made available through the project \u201cUse of conservation agriculture in crop-livestock systems (CLCA) in the drylands for enhanced water use efficiency, soil fertility and productivity in NEN and LAC countries\u201d funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), managed by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) and implemented in Tunisia by the National Agricultural Research Institute (INRAT).COMMENTS:The land under CA in Tunisia and Algeria is 14 000ha and 5600 ha, respectively.

Since 2016, the farmer applied conservation agriculture and mixed cropping to reduce land degradation, revive cropping practices, increase land productivity for agriculture and enhance soil health.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Otgontsetseg DavaanyamThe land in Kherlen soum, Khentii province, spanning 500 hectares, was used for crop production and later for producing fodder for livestock. However, since 1984, it has been left abandoned. To rehabilitate the area and revive cropland, conservation agriculture combined with mixed cropping was introduced in 2014.\nMixed cropping encompasses various agrotechnical practices that involve the cultivation of different crops together, making use of their ability to interact with each other. The aim is to sustain crop yield in regions with limited moisture, protect the soil surface, regulate soil moisture levels,  and enhance the availability of micro and macro-nutrients. In Kherlen soum, Khentii province, mixed cropping was implemented by planting seed mixtures of different proportions, taking into consideration the specific requirements and differences among various crops. Presently, annual crops such as mustard, peas, Cape rice, and wheat, rye along with rapeseeds, are successfully cultivated mixed and\/or in rotation in the area.\nConservation agriculture in soil protection agriculture offers several advantages, including the enhancement of soil, its resilience to external factors such as erosion by wind, regulation of soil fertility and microorganism populations, avoidance of highly toxic substances in agriculture, and increased productivity. One significant aspect of conservation agriculture is using no-till and direct sowing techniques to minimize soil disturbance. During harvesting, only the crop heads are collected, while the remaining rootsystems and stems are left in and above the soil contributing to increasing soil organic matter. Other residues and parts of plants, such as straw\/ stalks and leaves, are shredded and spread across the field to reduce soil moisture evaporation and protect it from the sun and wind. Soil erosion by wind can be mitigated by covering the soil as much and long as possible either by leaving the crop residues on the soil and\/or including cover crops into crop rotations. Furthermore, this technology improves the soil health and microenvironment\/ microclimate.\nTo initiate and implement this technology, the land user leased most of his land through a  proposal, aimed at improving the soil quality of abandoned land, to the local government, and also purchased a certain amount of land through a land auction announced on the government website. Initial preparation of land for sowing consisted of removing stones from the field and spraying herbicides to get rid of weeds and their seeds. A minimal dose of herbicides with low toxicity is used to control the growth and spread of weed plants commonly found in abandoned fields. Later on mustard was incorporated into mixed cropping and rotations suppressing the growth of weed.\nIn the first year, the farmer planted a mixture of mustard, oilseed rape and lucerne to enhance soil penetration and break up compacted soil, as well as wheat in a 40 cm strip on stony soil with low fertility. First few years 2014-2018), the farmer didn\u2019t harvest all the yields to keep the soil covered and improve the soil quality.\nIn 2019 the farmer built a fence to protect against grazing and yields significantly improved. Moreover, various equipment such as direct seeder for no till or minimum tillage crop cultivation, combine harvester, tractor, herbicide spraying machine and seed sorting machines to improve the quality of produce for the market (clean and separate seeds of different sizes and different types of crops) were bought with a bank loan.\nA comprehensive knowledge of the interactions and symbiotic relationships between different crops is also essential to plan for crop mixtures and rotations. Crop morphology such as root system, competition for nutrients and water should be considered. Mustard-pea mixture facilitates harvesting as pea is difficult to harvest in monoculture and mustard  can provide biological weed control.\nHe divided the land \/ field into 12 plots, which were planted with different crop mixtures and in rotation, maintaining soil fertility, limiting pests and diseases, and increasing crop yields. Legumes can improve soil fertility by adding nitrogen to the soil. The farmer practiced five-field rotation in his cropland using legumes including pea, bean, lentils and alfalfa. The rotation plan depends on climate conditions.\nThe levels of potassium and phosphorous in the soil were monitored and regularly measured. Only when a deficit occurred the land user used mineral fertilizers.\nAccording to farmers who practice conservation agriculture and mixed farming, these technologies effectively maintains soil stability, ensuring its long-term sustainability.COMMENTS:The area is not a part of the permanently protected area.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Harvesting and processing equipment|Digital technologies|Website|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1192, 1015, 1039, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|minimize pesticide use|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|Farm management|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|precision seeding and fertilization for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 921, 922, 926, 918, 919, 910, 914, 912, 908","readiness_level":"7.

Rainfall has become unpredictable and unreliable for sustainable farming This forces farmers to adapt to these changes using available conservation farming technologies such as Conservation Farming (CF) basins.\nCF basins are water conservation structures constructed in the garden during dry seasons. The basins store rainwater during rainy seasons and ensure water availability for plants during periods of little or no rainfall.\nDuring construction of the basins, plant residues in the field are slashed and retained within the garden. A common hoe is used to excavate rectangular holes of about 30cm x 20cm, having a depth of 15cm. The top soil is put on one side of the basin while the subsoil is put on the other side. When the basin is ready, the top soil is put back into the hole to cover about half of the total basin depth. The basin is now ready for planting at the onset of rains. The spacing between basins depends on the type of crop to be planted. For groundnuts (Arachis hypogaea) it\u0027s 30cm x 30cm.  The number of seeds per hole (seed rate) also depends on the crop. For maize, 3 plants per hole are to be planted, for groundnut, 6-8 plants per hole and for beans 6-8 plants per hole. \nThe basins are particularly important during critical growth periods such as germination, flowering and fruit seting if a sudden drought occurs. The basins conserve water, reduce surface runoff and support extended crop growth during dry seasons. After harvesting crop residues are put back into the basin to decompose so to build up humus in to basin.\nFarmers who practice this technology have reported healthy crop growth and reduced risk of crop failure. However, construction of CF basins is labour intensive because good basins need to be constructed in the dry season when the soil is hard. However, this challenge is outweighed by the fact that basins only need to be constructed once every 3-4 years.COMMENTS:Location where the CF basin technology was implementedSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1206, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 920, 918, 921, 917, 912","readiness_level":"7.

Crops can be planted early to make the best use of rainfall.

The stubble protects topsoil against loss to wind and rain and reduces chemical run-off to streams. By not plowing, farmers also conserve soil moisture, which can reduce irrigation demands. Farmers can save fuel by reducing the number of farm machinery passes across their fields. In simple terms, Conservation Tillage can be said to lie along a continuum of two other techniques: \nMinimum Tillage - mouldboard plowing is replaced by light tillage with tined implements, with or without a low toxicity non-residual herbicide to eliminate both perennial and annual weeds. 30% or more of the soil surface is kept covered by soil residues until final seedbed preparation. Conventional planting equipment can normally be used. Zero Tillage - planting is normally conducted without any preparatory tillage, or seedbed preparation. Normally, this technique requires specialized machinery for planting which can displace residues from the previous crop. A low toxicity non-residual herbicide application is recommended where growing weeds are present. There are numerous potential advantages of conservation tillage:\nFarming Benefits\nFor farmers the primary benefits of CT, achieved with any loss of yields, include:\n - More sustainable farming due to dramatic reductions in soil erosion caused by water or wind\n - More efficient conservation and utilization of water under dryland conditions\n - Improved energy efficiency as a result of reduced fuel requirements associated with fewer field operations\n - Greater crop and farm profitability through reduced direct and indirect costs for chemicals, fuel and labor.\nEnvironmental Benefits\nAt the same time, CT offers a number of significant benefits to the environment, these include:\n - Greater biodiversity than with standard cultivation practices where the surface has no crop residues\n - Reduces the build-up of soil sediments in reservoirs, drainage, ditches, etc. caused by soil erosion\n - Less pollution of drinking water sources caused by run-off of soil, fertilizers and pesticides\n - Reduced CO2 emissions due to increased soil organic matter level\n Furthermore, crops grown without tillage use water more efficiently, the water-holding capacity of the soil increases, and water losses from runoff and evaporation are reduced. For crops grown without irrigation in drought-prone soils, this more efficient water use can translate into higher yields. In addition, soil organic matter and populations of beneficial insects are maintained, soil and nutrients are less likely to be lost from the field and less time and labor is required to prepare the field for planting. In general, the greatest advantages of reduced tillage are realized on soils prone to erosion and drought. Also achieved are greater water-stability of surface soil aggregates, higher microbial activity and earthworm populations and higher total carbon. Soil loss is less from sprinkler irrigation than in the plow treatment.COMMENTS:\u0022Tipid Saka\u0022 is being practiced by farmers in the sites of San Jose, Mindoro Occidental since the dry season cropping (1999-2000) with the entry of UPLB Corn project and Monsanto Philippines, Inc.\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 100 km2.Major cash crop: rice, corn\nMajor food crop: rice, vegetables\nOther: fruits, tobacco\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Continuous salinization due to intrusion of salt water and soil fertility decline.

The Ripper consists of a frame that is attached to a common plough beam and on this frame is fixed a tine at an angle that penetrates and breaks up the soil when pulled. Only the region where the crop furrow will be is loosened by the tine and by so doing reducing the amount of tillage and disruption of soil structure while preserving the crop residue cover. The frame has some \u2018wings\u2019 attached to it that throw the soil out of the ripped furrow to leave it open for planting and collecting of water. Ripping is done in one pass up to a depth of 15cm depending on the strength of the oxen, soil type, hitch assembly settings and the sharpness of the tine.\nPurpose of the Technology: Reducing tillage first of all reduces tillage costs and tillage time allowing more time for the farmer to plant early and\/or a bigger area. Reducing tillage also reduces the loss of soil organic matter and the destructive effects to the soil structure ultimately improving soil fertility and soil water conservation. Ripping does not invert the soil, hence it does not bury crop residues which further enhance organic matter levels and protect the soil from excessive evaporation and erosion. The open furrow left by the ripper collects water from the adjacent untilled soil much in the same way basins (zai system) are used for water harvesting. This together with the increased rooting depth resulting from the breaking of compacted soil, enhanced infiltration and early planting improves water conservation and hence the resilience of crop to extended dry spells.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The establishment of ripping based conservation tillage mainly involves the purchase of the ripper frame and the\nreplaceable tines. Liming acidic soils (low pH soils) followed by a final ploughing will be required to correct the soil pH which otherwise will be difficult to correct once conservation tillage has been established. The main establishment activity involves adopting a new mindset and increasing the knowledge base to apply the technology correctly. Knowledge about alternative weed control practices and herbicide use is particularly cardinal as the farmer will have to adopt new weeding practices and routines in the absence of ploughing. Maintenance activities are more or less the same as conventional tillage except for replacing the tillage tines which wear every now and then. The same applies for the inputs except for the increase in use of herbicides.\nNatural \/ human environment: Ripping is best performed in dry season when the soil is dry although this may not be possible with some of the smaller and\/or weak oxen when the soil is too dry. It is therefore recommended for farmers in regions that experience long dry seasons to rip at the end of harvest before the soils get too dry and hard and when the oxen are in good condition before they lose weight and strength due to less feed and water, excessive heat as the dry season progresses.\nThe ripper is mostly suited to small-scale farmers just adopting Conservation Agriculture (CA) since the tool can be easily adapted to the existing plough beam which most of the farmers already have. The small capital outlay for establishing the system makes it suited to resource poor and risk-averse farmers.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Loss of soil structure and loss of soil fertility\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Droughts and dry dpells\nLivestock is grazing on crop residuesSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 917, 920, 918, 910, 914, 909, 922","readiness_level":"7.

Land Development Department had surveyed, designed and constructed the 3 meters wide of continuous bench terrace, which it is suitable for the tea cultivation and total area is approximately 100 rai. The Angkhang Royal Agricultural Station had selected 50 households of Palaung hill tribe who have more ability and aptitude to grow Chinese tea to participate in the Chinese tea development and promotion project in 2000 and named this area as \u0022Plot 2000\u0022. The overview of this area is complex mountainous terrain with slope range 16-30 percent, and average attitude is 1,400 meters above sea level. The soil texture is silty loam and very deep (more tan 1.2 meter), almost well drained soil. The soil organic matter is moderate around 1-3 percent. Moreover, the data of Doi Ang Khang Meteorological Station (Station Code 48302) is located at average attitude 1,529 meters above the sea level, and average temperature throughout the year is 22.9  Celsius with the highest temperature is 32.1 Celsius (during May) and the lowest temperature is 3.9 Celsius (during December), and average annual rainfall is 1,925.3 mm, with rain starting from April to October.\nIn the past, the watershed areas in northern Thailand have been disturbed by natural disasters, climate change, and human threats. The hill tribe people had invaded the forest to grow opium and shifting cultivation continuously. These condition caused the serious problem in soil erosion, runoff with soil surface, lose of topsoil and plant nutrients, decreasing in soil fertility and productivity with the extremely damage to upstream forest ecosystem. Until in the year 1969, Angkhang Royal Agricultural Station was established from the initiative of His Majesty King Rama 9, which aimed to conduct research on the planting of winter economic crops as an example for hill tribe to plant those crops as their career instead of opium cultivation, and also stop cutting and shifting cultivation. Nowadays there are more than 50 species of economic plants in this project and generating more income for land users, more than that this slopping area is the sustainable in land use and land management under organization of the Royal Project Foundation.\nThe benefits this technology is important in sustainable utilization of land resources in this area, and all land users around the Angkhang Royal Agricultural Station have stable and more income because they can grow Chinese tea and also other winter economic crops on this highland throughout the year. Moreover, this continuous bench terrace is more convenient for land users in fertilizer application, soil improvement, machines operation, tea harvesting and also yield transportation from cultivated plots to local processing factory.\nThe impact of implementation continuous bench terrace with 3 meters based:\n1. The obvious economic and social impacts of land users are the stability of income from the production of Chinese tea, which are produced throughout the year. This conservation is more convenient for land users to implement in their plot and also transport from cultivated plots to local processing factory. The local officers from Angkhang Royal Agricultural Station and others government agencies closely advised and guided breeding, planting, soil management, harvesting and price guarantee.\n2. The environmental and ecological impact is to reduce the amount of runoff and soil sediment, increase soil moisture, preserve soil nutrients and fertility, encourage biodiversity in the area of Plot 2000.\n3. The society and culture impact is all ethnic groups are given the opportunity to receive the allocation of arable land according to the group of plants that they are comfortable and want to produce. Thus respecting the use of land in zoning as allocated from the station, including right to use water.  These caused the strength of community institutions, where they have various crop production groups, organic fertilizer production Group and others. They are all member of the cooperative of the community.COMMENTS:Angkhang Royal Agricultural Station is an area for research and development for the winter crops and trees around 1,811 rai, with high from the sea level 1,400 meters. There are hill tribe villages around the station and the total population is about 3,215 people. The weather is cool all year round with the average temperature is 17.7 degrees, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees in April. And the minimum temperature of -3 degrees in January. The average rainfall is 2,075 mm per year and slope area 20-35%.Palaung hill tribe will plant Chinese tea on this area in late rainy season, about August to October because after planting root of tea would grow well in the cool condition and do not face problems like during the rainy season. The trimming will be about 10-12 months before planting. spacing between row is 1.2 meter and between tree is 60 centimeters. There are about 2,200 trees per Rai.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Social and socio-economic","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1076","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|income increase|field management|Access to knowledge and advisory|access to agricultural advice|Collective action and aggregation|cooperative management to improve efficiency and governance","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 921, 918, 920, 910, 1180, 914, 965, 967, 973, 974","readiness_level":"9.

Continuous cover cropping has been promoted as an agri-environmental measure of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) by Veneto region to extend sustainable land management and reduce diffuse water pollution. Indeed cover crops incorporate available inorganic N that remains within the soil after harvest and reduce water erosion. The type of crop species depends on the crop succession.\nPurpose of the Technology: Cover crops have been proposed to the farmers with the aim of reducing environmental impacts of traditional agricultural practices. Compared with systems that does not use cover crops, the continuous soil cover provides long-term agronomical and environmental benefits due to a reduction of negative impacts on agro-ecosystems.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The application of cover crops involves the alternation of autumn-winter cereals, rapeseed or other herbaceous crops with maize, soybean, sorghum etc. Cover crops that are sown after the main culture are neither fertilized nor treated with pesticides during growing, while at the end of the crop cycle they are buried as green manure in order to improve soil organic matter content, nutrient cycle and finally soil fertility.\nNatural \/ human environment: Growing seasonal cover crops between annual crops have the potential to provide multiple benefits in a cropping system. Cover crops prevent water erosion and pollution as well as increase soil physical properties. Due to the effect of green manure and root growth, cover crops supply nutrients and increase soil organic matter content. They improve soil biodiversity and break pest cycles.COMMENTS:Main crops : e.g. barley and vetch, ryegrass, sorghum\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soils in the low Venetian plain of the Veneto region generally suffer from a loss of soil organic matter (SOM) that is strongly affected by their natural texture and climatic conditions. Moreover, in the last 50 years intensive tillage practices contributed to a further SOM decrease, estimated at 0.02-0.58 t\/ha\/y of carbon. Finally, high intensive agriculture practices increased nonpoint source pollution and in turn caused a decline of surface and groundwater quality.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): To date, few farmers have adopted voluntarily the continuous soil cover to reduce a decline of soil fertility and water quality, symptom of poor perception of the problem.

It is widely adopted by the ethnic minorities of Nepal who practice the shifting cultivation system of farming. Over generations, they have successfully used this technology to control soil erosion, promote water retention, and increase crop production. It has a high probability of replication because it is simple to implement, is low cost, and makes the maximum use of local resources.\nPurpose of the Technology: Farmers use a multi-step process to promote the formation of rough terraces along contour lines on sloping land. First the vegetation on the shifting cultivation plot (mostly fodder and forage trees and bushes) is cut down and the leaves and small twigs removed from the branches by slashing. All the material is left on the surface to dry. The leaves and twigs gradually decompose. After a few weeks, the remaining dry material is rolled into bundles and arranged along contour lines. The material is anchored with pegs, stones, and (where possible) tree stumps. This is the beginning of the contour bund. The farmers then incorporate the remaining leaf litter and decomposed organic matter into the soil between the bunds and plant crops. Over time, as the soil gradually deposits above each bund and is eroded below, rough terraces are formed. The process is labour intensive and farmers need to regularly check and maintain the bunds to allow the soil to collect.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Contour bunding is relatively easy to establish and maintain since it does not require external inputs and local unskilled labourers can make them using locally available woody materials. It is also both sustainable and ecofriendly since there are no external inputs and no organic matter is burned in the process.\nThe use of contour bunding is limited by the fact that it is labour intensive and that bunding cannot be implemented during the fallow period of the shifting cultivation cycle, thus it can only be applied on a plot for two years (the cultivation period of the shifting cultivation cycle).COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Shifting cultivation is a traditional farming system practice used by the ethnic minorities who farm marginal, hilly, and sloping land.

The bottom bund is up to 80 m long, and the wingwalls extend up to 15 m upslope. The contour bunds are built in staggered rows along the natural contour of the land with the open end facing uphill. Patches in the same row are spaced 6 m apart, and the rows are positioned about 25 m apart, depending of the gradient of the slope. Downslope of the structure, a water collection ditch 0.50 m wide and 0.30 m deep is dug. The earth excavated from the ditch is piled up and compacted to construct the main bund. When used for growing crops, a third of the total surface area inside the contour bunds is loosened by subsoiling. The remaining two thirds of the surface are left unworked and serve as a catchment area. This doubles or triples the volume of water available to crops. Trees are planted along the main bund to stabilise the structure.\nContour bunds for forest\/rangeland work as contour bunds on cropland (described above), except that the sizing is slightly different. The main bund of patches used for this purpose is up to 100 m long and the rows are spaced up to 30 m apart.\nIn Niger, contour bunds for forest\/rangeland are used to restore land in plateau areas which have been completely degraded and denuded by severe water and wind erosion. Contour  bunds for growing crops are recommended for the restoration of pediments, particularly in areas where land use pressure is high. The technique is recommended for areas with a low gradient and rainfall of less than 600 mm.\nThe bunds capture and retain runoff for several days. Infiltration of the water into the soil increases, and there is a gradual build-up of sediment behind the bunds, creating favourable conditions for the establishment of vegetation. Contour bunds for crops increase the area of land that can be farmed and its productivity thanks to their capacity to retain runoff and the shelter provided by trees planted along the bottom bund, which protects the crops. An advantage from the perspective of watershed development is that contour bunds constructed on plateaux areas protect areas downstream against heavy runoff.\nBefore constructing the contour bunds, it is essential to clarify the ownership status of the land where the measures are to be implemented and who the users will be, with a view to avoiding disputes later on.\nWhen constructing the contour bunds, it is important to mark out the contour lines correctly and ensure that the earth is firmly compacted.\nWith some upkeep, stone or stone-lined contour bunds last at least 20 years. Earthen bunds do not last as long. Good vegetation cover established along the bunds increases their lifetime.\nThe Sahel is a region where the population has always faced a high degree of climate variability, manifested both in terms of time (unexpected dry spells can occur during the rainy season) and in terms of space (rainfall can vary greatly from one area to another). The population is mainly composed of small farmers and livestock keepers.\nOver the last two decades, the effects of climate change have exacerbated the already difficult conditions. Accord\u00acing to projections made by climatologists, the Sahel will experience a rise in temperatures combined with highly variable rainfall and an increase in extreme weather events.\nThe Soil and Water conservation and rehabilitation techniques have helped people in the Sahel to manage their ecosystems more effectively and improve their productive land. As a result, communities are better prepared to cope with environmental changes (changes in the climate, land degradation, etc.) and the im\u00acpact of shocks, particularly droughts.COMMENTS:major cash crop: Ground nut\nmajor food crops: Millet\nother: Sorghum, cow pea and mangoes\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): crusting, surface runoff, water and wind erosion, unadapted land use methods, rapidly growing population increasing pressure on land, reduced or abandoned fallow periods, insecure access to land\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: farmers are mainly agropastoralists with some communities specialised on pure pastoralism\nConstraints of forested government-owned land or commons\nLivestock density: 1-10 LU \/km2SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Policy|Inclusion and Equity-Oriented Policies|Appropriate technology promotion|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation|Low-cost farming tools and techniques","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1206, 1188, 1191, 1095, 1136, 1111, 1076, 1088, 1089","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|Farm management|field management|disaster management|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 927, 921, 920, 918, 910, 914, 1154, 1186","readiness_level":"9.

This minimizes runoff-induced erosion.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Harifidy RAKOTO RATSIMBAContour farming involves cultivating the soil perpendicular to the slope: that is ploughing along the contour.  Contour farming is suitable for gently sloping terrain (\u003C 5%). On land with steeper slopes (\u226510%), it is necessary to combine tillage with other erosion control measures, such as the use of grass strips. However, cultivating on very steep slopes is not advisable due to their high exposure to erosion.\nThis technology enhances water availability for plants in the soil, reducing surface runoff and slowing down the velocity of water during runoff. Nevertheless, working the soil perpendicular to the slope can pose challenges on narrow plots:\n- more passes are needed, which takes more time;\n- the slope sometimes makes it difficult to maintain plough stability;\n- in the case of single-share ploughs, if the slope is steep, the direction of passage is particularly difficult.\nThe ideal way to work the soil is to follow contour lines, but this recommendation is sometimes difficult or even impossible to apply when the terrain is uneven. Contour surveying can also be too demanding for some farmers. In such cases, identifying the general cross-slope direction becomes a practical recommendation, even if it does not strictly adhere to contour lines.\nThis type of tillage not only protects downstream plots from sand and sediment influx, but also prevents the loss of useful soil onsite, thereby improving water infiltration. It also facilitates the conservation of organic matter from crop residues and encourages biological life in the soil.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 920, 910, 914, 917, 918","readiness_level":"9.

They are planted at a horizontal distance of 6 meters between rows and 15-20 centimeters between cuttings within lines. On average it requires 3500-4000 Napier slips to cover one acre (0.4 ha). Hedgerows form living barriers that trap sediment and reduce surface runoff. With time, as the sediment builds up behind the hedges, the area between the hedgerows develops into flat alleys or \u201cterrace beds\u201d. This technology is effective in reducing soil erosion and conserving water. The hedgerows also boost crop productivity. The contour hedgerow system is widely used in hilly terrain in Bhutan and elsewhere.\nThe main purposes of the technology are to 1) serve as a barrier to check the movement of soil and water down the slope, 2) effectively utilize sloping areas for agricultural purposes, and 3) increase crop and fodder production.\nThe major activities\/ inputs needed to establish\/ maintain contour hedgerows are: 1) surveying of the area by an SLM specialist (planning and site assessment), 2) selecting suitable hedgerow planting materials, 3) registration of interested farmers, 4) training of farmers, 5) layout of contour lines using A-frames, 6) distribution of planting materials and establishment of hedgerows in farmland, 7) monitoring and evaluation of hedgerows, and 8) maintenance of hedgerows. Maintenance includes replacement of cuttings in gaps - either damaged by cattle or natural mortality and trimming of grass back to 15 centimeters after reaching 1 meter. Inputs required include: 1) planting materials (Napier grass), 2) A-Frame for contour lines, 3) spades, pickaxes, shovels, crowbars, etc., and 4) human resource input by SLM specialists.\nContour hedgerows have many benefits\/ impacts on the livelihood of the land users including 1) soil and water conservation, 2) use of the sloping areas for crop or fodder production, 3) effective conservation through using local materials with a 90% survival rate, 4) habitat for natural predators, pollinators, insect-eating birds, and rodent predators, 5) groundwater recharge, and 6) they beautify the overall agricultural landscape.  Another important benefit of the hedgerows is the availability of fodder grass for livestock, which otherwise would have to be collected from the forest. The disadvantages include the need for regular maintenance and gapping up. At times, conflicts arise within the community due to grazing of hedges by neighbors\u2019 cattle.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Production|crop production|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|animal production|livestock monitoring","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 917, 897, 898, 920, 910, 914, 918, 919, 899, 905","readiness_level":"9.

Hedgerows of alfalfa also provide quality animal fodder for a period of 5-10 years.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Bettina WolfgrammProject supported implementation of hedgerows has taken place in the villages of Sari Joy and Jawaz Khana, located in Chokar watershed of Rustaq District in Northern Afghanistan. The Chokar watershed is a mountainous area situated between 600 m and 2,500 m above sea level. The climate is semi-arid with harsh and cold weather in winter and hot and dry summers. The annual precipitation in average years is 580mm. Land degradation affects all forms of land use and includes sparse vegetation cover, severe top soil erosion through rainfall runoff, and poor soil fertility. Unsustainable agricultural practices, and over-exploitation of the natural resources are adversely impacting the socio-economic well-being of local communities, as well as contributing to the risk of being adversely affected by drought, landslides and flash foods triggered by heavy rainfall. The data used for the documentation of the technology are based on field research conducted in Chokar watershed, namely in the villages of Sari Joy and Jawaz Khana. These villages represent the upper and the middle zone of Chokar watershed, respectively. They differ considerably in access to services and infrastructure, but in general are poorly served. The communities depend on land resources for sustaining their livelihoods. In a good year with high yields, wheat self-sufficiency lasts about 5 months. The three villages are home to ethnic Qarluq communities. Since 2012 the Livelihood Improvement Project Takhar (LIPT) implemented by Terre des hommes (Tdh) Switzerland has initiated a range of NRM interventions.\nHedgerows are vegetative strips, planted as contour barriers. In this case they are composed of the perennial legume alfalfa (sometime called lucerne: Medicago sativa),  Using an A-frame, contours are defined and demarcated horizontally across the hillside. The distance between the contours depends on the slope gradient. For moderate slopes above 6%, and hilly slopes below 30%, the distance between the contours is 4-5 meters. Using such contouring measurements, a plot area of 0.2 ha is divided into 8 hedgerows along the slope. Once all the contours are established, the topsoil is levelled using a shovel. On each marked contour a soil ridge is created, some 10-20 cm high. On these ridges alfalfa seeds are sown to form the vegetative hedgerow. This stops soil wash, and prevents most of the rainfall runoff. The area between the grass strips is cropped with wheat. The hedgerows are protected for one year, to allow the alfalfa to become established. \nHedgerows were introduced in the local villages  to promote low-cost land management practices, which are sustainable and well adapted to the local environmental conditions. Apart from reducing soil erosion, this new practice takes into account the needs of local people to improve soil fertility and increase agricultural yields.   Local land users were trained to establish hedgerows on their own land using low amount of inputs. They were given the technical knowledge required. Over the past four years of implementation the land users report noticeable improvements on their plots. The soil is protected from erosion, and the households harvest wheat for the family and alfalfa for their livestock. \nOne of the key benefits of the technology is that it does not require many or costly inputs and it is relatively easy to establish without technical support. Improved production and availability of alfalfa is a primary benefit from the land users\u0027 point of view. They can harvest fodder from the plot for up to 10 years without reseeding. \nHedgerows are among the least labour-intensive SLM practices and thereby do not have a significant influence on the daily household workload of local women. This feature of the technology is perceived as its strength by many female family members.COMMENTS:This documentation is based on the experiences of SLM implementers from Sari Joy (3 plots) and Jawaz Khana, (3 plots) as compiled during FGDs. Additionally insights were gained through interviews in the villages on farmers experiences and observations of hedgerow plots, with both SLM implementers (5) and observers (7).SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 916, 921, 917, 918, 922, 910, 914, 909","readiness_level":"7.

This approach is combined with seeding and cultivation of crop lines along the contour. The soil is tilled in a perpendicular direction to the slope and to the direction of water flow over the soil surface (i.e. across the slope\/ along the contour) in order to:\n- slow down runoff water to maximize infiltration of rainwater into the soil;\n- reduce the amount of soil, nutrients and organic matter carried downstream by runoff; and\n- promote optimum use of rainwater and nutrients by plants.\nTo further facilitate the penetration of water into the soil, producers make earth checks within furrows every 2 to 3 meters to prevent lateral water movement. This reduces the risk of water concentration and ridge breakage and improves drought resilience. The checks can be created manually with a hoe or mechanically. In the case of trailed or motorized cultivation, all that is required is to lift the plough at regular intervals.\nIn addition, on moderate slopes and in areas subject to heavy rainfall, structures such as stone barriers, bunds and terraces should be used. Furthermore, to optimize soil management, producers use plant residues as a means of returning nutrients and organic matter to the soil. To this end, they mulch the soil with harvest residues.\nThus, they combine contour ploughing with residue management, which has the following advantages, among others:\n- reduced loss of organic matter and nutrients through runoff;\n- increased amount of rainwater retained by the soil;\n- soil aeration to facilitate rooting and water infiltration; and\n- erosion control through reduced runoff.COMMENTS:Contour lines should be traced and tracked to ensure perpendicularity to the slope.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 918, 920, 897, 898, 910, 914, 909, 922","readiness_level":"9.

The technology is applied on steep to very steep slopes. It ist characterised by two elements: 1) small bench terrace with one contour-oriented vine row per terrace and 2) an initially sown all-year green cover of the soil surface for stabilisation reasons (green cover is also used between vine rows which are oriented up and down the slope, eg not terraced, see SWI01).\nPurpose: Main purpose of the terrace construction is a possible mechanisation on steep to very steep slopes. Direct purpose of the green cover is the stabilisation of the small terraces, indirect but important purpose is the prevention of soil degradation, especially soil erosion by water and - secondary - to protect soil surface from compactation when using mechanised equipment.\nEstablishment: The terraces are constructed by external specialists and heavy machinery (walking excavator, type \u0022Menzi Muck\u0022) and are considered to serve for a whole life cycle of the vine (20-40 years). The green cover is sown since stabilisation is needed from the very beginning on. The duration of the establishment is 3 years. Because of insufficient root length of young vines agronomic and vegetative measures differ from the \u0022normal\u0022 measures: For reasons of competition the space around the freshly planted vines is kept free from vegetation with a hoe.\nMaintenance: the topsoil is ripped from time to time with fuel driven machine (spade machine tracked by tractor). Cover vegetation is either cut or chopped and serves as mulching . Herbicides are applied around the vines. Minimum tillage and cutting \/ mulching may additionally serve to mobilise nutrients and to increase organic matter content or to eliminate competition of cover vegetation.\nNatural environment: the vineyards are mainly placed on mountain or hill slopes, below 600 m a.s.l., annual rainfall is around 1000 mm with at least one erosive storm per year. The geological underground is limy, locally layered by Molasse (type of conglomerate). Soil properties are strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities (viticulture). Main degradation problem without green cover is erosion by water.\nHuman environment \/ land use: the region has a strong wine growing tradition (several centuries), belongs to the important Swiss wine growing regions and is not very densly populated.\nFirst experiments with green cover in Switzerland were done in the 70ies around Z\u00fcrich on contour small bench terraces, in the region of the lake of Biel contour small bench terraces with green cover started to be implemented in the 80iesCOMMENTS:The technology is applied in all winegrowing regions of Switzerland, but under different conditions. Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The main problem was decreasing soil fertility, especially throug soil erosion by water with negative off-site effects like sand- \/sediment deposition and contamination of groundwater by nutrients. It became a serious problem since the 60ies when the fact became visible that the traditional labour-intensive cultivation system, which was strongly dependent on external inputss, could no longer be sustained within an industrialised agriculture system.\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: a vine plantation is established for a period of 20-40 years (lifetime of a vine). Some farmers make one year of fallow between the destruction of the old and the establishment of a new plantation.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|minimize pesticide use|Farm management|field management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 922, 917, 918, 920, 926, 910, 914","readiness_level":"9.

This practice is recommended in fields that have plenty of surface stones (\u003E 20%). Construction of contour stone bunds not only helps to get rid of the excess surface stones and gravel but also reduces the slope gradient through formation of partial terraces over a few years.\nThe stone bund is not new to Bhutan, being a mountainous country, forefathers used the technique to remove stones from the field and stabilise the land for agricultural purposes. Therefore, there were some traditional stone lines constructed in the study area.\nConstructing stone bund is labour intensive, therefore land users resort to a labour sharing approach where all the land users from the community come together and work on a rotational basis until every household in the community has established stone bunds.\nThe major activities and inputs required to establish the contour stone bund includes sensitization of beneficiaries, followed by SLM action planning, and hands-on-training. Field implementation follows this sequence: (a) determination of intervals between stone bunds, (b) demarcation of contour lines using an \u2018A\u2019 frame, (c) digging a trench of 0.1 - 0.2 m deep and 0.5 m wide to establish a foundation along the contour lines, and (d) constructing stone lines along the trenches with the larger stones at the base to set a sound foundation. A typical stone wall is 0.3 m high (1 ft) and 0.3 - 0.5 m wide, but this depends on the slope and availability of stones in the field. Contour stone bunds are commonly spaced 6 metres apart on slopes of 60%. In some cases, the fodder grass slips are also planted at the base of the stone bund for better stabilization of the bunds and fodder availability.\nThe major drawbacks of this SLM technology according to respondents are (a) labour demanding, (b) no immediate return, and (c) the space between piled stones harbours rodents leading to crop damage.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 910, 914, 897, 898, 922, 918, 915","readiness_level":"9.

They are constructed in lines along the natural contour of the land after 10-15 cm of the soil has been removed from the line where they are to be built. They should be built to a height of 20-30 cm from the ground and spaced 20 to 50 m apart depending on the inclination of the terrain.\nThe best results are achieved when contour stone bunds are used in combination with biological measures (planting of grass, trees and hedges) and the use of organic fertiliser and mulching.\nPurpose of the Technology: Contour stone bunds protect the land against sheet erosion caused by runoff. They form a barrier that slows down runoff and spreads it more evenly over the land. By slowing the flow of water over the land, it can seep into the soil and prevents the loss of rainwater. The bunds also act as a filter, trapping  fine waterborne particles of soil and manure, resulting in a build-up of sediment and the formation of terraces. The seeds of grasses and shrubs are also trapped by the bunds, favouring the establishment of natural vegetation along the structure. This further stabilises the soil and the bunds and contributes to conserving the biodiversity of plants and small wild animals (monitor lizards, birds, snakes and other reptiles). If good vegetation cover is developed on the stone bunds, they also lower soil temperature and provide protection against wind erosion. Excess water filters through the bunds and infiltrates into the soil. When rainfall is erratic, the stone bunds contribute to conserving more moisture in the soil for longer, which helps to alleviate water stress during dry spells. There is evidence that bunds that have been in place for over 15 years have positive effects on yields.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: A minimum amount of upkeep is required, which essentially involves replacing stones dislodged by animals or water flow. The lifespan of a stone bund is over 20 years.\nIn order to optimise the positive effects of stone bunds, it is important to ensure that they are constructed closely following the natural contour of the land and in accordance with the established technical standards.\nThe means of transport required depends on the proximity of a quarry or a supply of stones (cart or lorry).\nNatural \/ human environment: This technique is designed for cropland, but can also be used on forest\/rangeland. It is suitable for areas in the Sahel and the Sudan with rainfall ranging between 300 and 900 mm\/year and low-to-medium gradient  terrain.\nWhen rainfall is high, they protect the land in the event of heavy rain, a phenomenon that tends to increase with climate change.COMMENTS:Large-scale areas have been protected in most Sahel countries.

Next activity is harrowing, which is usually done twice to pulverize the soil. Plastic mulching is a also a practice after bedding to suppress weeds and conserve water. Weeding is done manually. Foliar fertilizer spraying is done to induce flowering.\nNatural \/ human environment: The area is under humid agro-climate condition with a topography ranging from 1-10% slope. It receives an annual average rainfall of approximately 3072 mm. The elevation ranges from 370-890 meter above sea level.\nMt.

Combined with unsustainable land management practices, climatic stresses have exacerbated land degradation and made local livelihoods increasingly vulnerable.\nAs part of the Food Systems, Land Use and Restoration (FOLUR) project, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) designed and tested rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures to combat land degradation and enhance rural livelihoods. These RWH structures support vegetation growth, reduce surface runoff, prevent erosion, and restore soil health\u2014thereby reversing degradation and improving agricultural productivity.\nBased on slope gradients and hydrological characteristics, two RWH techniques were selected: modified contour trenches for the slightly sloping upper areas, and modified contour strips for the flatter zones.\nIn the upper portion of the site, which spans 1.54 hectares, modified contour trenches were implemented for perennial tree crops. Design calculations suggested a spacing of 8 metres between trenches, and 7 metres between almond trees along each trench.\nImplementation began with the marking of contour lines using a laser level: two labourers worked for two days. Then a tractor fitted with a three-mouldboard plough dug the trenches. While the tractor generally performed well, work had to be completed manually at sharp bends and gully crossings. Eight labourers then spent two days shaping and stabilizing the trenches. In total, approximately 1,300 metres of trench lines were created.\nCosts were relatively modest. The tractor, hired from a farmer, cost $150 per day. Manual labour amounted to 24 person-days at $10 per day. 100 almond trees were planted, and 85 tamarix trees were added as a protective windbreak.\nIn the lower, flatter part of the site\u2014about 1.68 hectares\u2014standard contour strips were unsuitable due to the very low slope, which would not generate enough runoff. Instead, a modified version was implemented. Low ridges along contour at a vertical interval of 30 cm, allowed rainwater to pool and infiltrate. The same tractor was used with a single mouldboard plough to form nine contour ridges, shaped by two passes.\nAfterwards, ten local women labourers finalized the ridges manually. The total length of the contour strips reached 500 metres, and the ratio of catchment to cultivated area varied from 5:1 in the upper sections to 1:1 in the lower zones, based on expected runoff.\nThe cost of this phase included one day of tractor use and 15 person-days of labour, totalling approximately $300. This site is intended for rainfed cultivation, and will follow a crop rotation system including barley, legumes and fallow periods. Over time, farmers are encouraged to adopt no-till practices to improve soil health.\nFollowing implementation, light rainfall provided a test of the structures. Both the contour trenches and strips performed as intended, with no damage observed.\nThe interventions demonstrate how a tailored combination of RWH structures and cropping systems can rehabilitate degraded land. Local involvement helped to build community ownership. The result is a more productive and climate-resilient landscape that offers long-term benefits for soil conservation and rural livelihoods.\nAcknowledgement: This SLM was introduced by ICARDA in the framework of Food Systems, Land Use and Restoration Impact Program (FOLUR) in Uzbekistan (GCP\/UZB\/010\/GFF), implemented by FAO with funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF)COMMENTS:Note fruits\/ nuts on one part of the land and cereals\/ legumes\/ fodder on another section (see 2.2)SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|optimization of resource use for better production|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|income increase","use_cases_id":"916, 918, 921, 897, 898, 909, 920, 910, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

Grazing in forest is controlled because it is limited to specific areas and with a controlled number of animals (cows and goats). In deciduous forest, the animals can still find green grass in the dry season. This action prevents excessive stress in the surrounding rangelands, which are suffering from a seasonal summer water deficit, as is typical of areas with a Mediterranean climate.\nPurpose of the Technology: One purpose of this management technology is to allow grazing in environments that still preserve grasses in the summer dry season. Moreover, this technology can prevent overgrazing (and its consequences in rangeland and pastures). Controlled grazing is typical in the Rendina watershed (Basilicata, Italy).\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The upper part of the watershed is located above 800 m a.s.l. and is characterized by deciduous oak forest, which every 20 years is subject to selective cutting. Selective cutting involves cutting a high percentage of a limited range of tree species. Within about 10 years, regeneration of the whole wooded area is possible. This allows for a constant regeneration of the woodland and reduces the probability of a progressive degradation as well as of wildfires due to an excessive build-up of the fuel load. The surrounding areas are either cultivated or rangeland and suffer from the soil erosion and landslides that give rise to degradation and hence to the loss of arable lands.\nNatural \/ human environment: Forests are either government-owned or privately-owned, but controlled grazing woodland areas are mostly government-owned. Based on the number of grazing animals admitted, the farmers need to pay a tax to the municipalities or regions. Each farmer has a specific number of animals admitted to the woodland area and there is a overall maximum of animals especially during summer, when a risk of overgrazing exists. Access to private forest, on the other hand, is arranged directly with the owners.\nGrazing is organized on a daily basis by the herdsman. The controlled grazing areas are always located in the woodlands where selective cutting is carried out. In such areas livestock during summer can enter and move more easily in the relatively cool conditions.\nWhen controlled grazing is adopted as the conventional management technology, selective cutting of trees every 20 years is also used to provide additional earnings from the sale of firewood.\nAnnual rainfall is 500 mm with two rainy seasons (October-November and March-May). Potential evapotranspiration is up to 1100 mm annually. The Rendina catchment ranges from humid-subhumid to subhumid-semiarid conditions.

Although the primary purpose is to produce milk for domestic consumption and for sale, the other subsidiary aim is to generate manure to replenish soil fertility on continuously cultivated and nutrient depleted land and pasture that the cows graze on. During the rainy season crops are planted and animals fed by cut and carry or pegged\/ tied with a radius of 2-5 meters. During dry season the animals can graze on crop residues\nFor this technology, cattle are tethered\/ tied on a pole (pegged) or tree using a sisal rope.  Tethering distance should allow each cow to access pasture uninterrupted by others. The animals are rotated\/ relocated routinely to minimise overgrazing in a given location. The manure produced is collected daily, and kept in heaps to compost for periods of 2 to 3 weeks, before being ferried to the fields for application for the cultivation of maize and other crops like soya bean . This technology requires possession of sufficient land for grazing the animals, as well as sufficient labour for handling manure through composting up to field application. The key inputs required for establishing this technology include labour, hand hoes, spades, sisal ropes, basins, sacks and basket for collecting manure and its transportation to the maize field, watering containers , spraying pumps for spraying animals against ticks and feeds to supplement the grazing during shortage of pasture.\nThe benefits derived from such a technology are both short and long term, including access to increased manure to apply on crop fields especially maize for increased production\nTo replicate this technology, the land user needs to have knowledge and skills on how to manage the animals to generate high quality manure, compost it and maintain it free of contamination with pesticides sprayed on the animals against pests and diseases, which may affect the quality of the manure and the safety of the users.COMMENTS:Map showing  Controlled livestock grazing  technology site  in Gulu District, Northern Uganda.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Animal management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1195, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|animal production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|livestock monitoring|animal health|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 898, 916, 921, 905, 907, 909","readiness_level":"7.

This is to reduce the total compacted area, to improve connections, and to optimise overlapping of return runs, resulting in more efficient use of labour and inputs. Risks from environmental pollution are also reduced. The technology is applied to arable fields.\nThe main principle is to confine all machinery-earth contact to the least possible area by using permanent traffic lanes. The aim is to minimise the area compacted area while improving connections and optimising the cover of operations (so that, for example, spraying doesn\u2019t double the dose on a portion of the crop). For application of the technology, working widths of machines have to be synchronised to use the same (or multiple) working widths. For keeping directions and parallel traffic precisely Real Time Correction GPS need to be used.\nThe key benefit of the technology is that the compacted area can be reduced to 15-20% of the field and this is always in the same place. Due to the precision of next\/ return runs of machinery, this means more efficient use of time and 15-20% less input materials used. Risk of environment pollution is correspondingly smaller. Under this system, conventional tillage (e.g. mouldboard ploughing) is not possible, only reduced, non-inversion tillage (\u201cno-till\u201d) can be employed. Correspondingly, mechanical weed control may be less effective under this system.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Vehicles and machinery|Digital technologies|GPS|Advanced positioning systems|Geospatial technologies","type_id":"993, 1188, 1194, 1015, 1028, 1055, 1052","use_cases":"Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|optimization of resource use for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact|equipment management|precision seeding and fertilization for better production","use_cases_id":"910, 914, 897, 898, 909, 916, 921, 925, 913, 908","readiness_level":"7.

It is a simple method entailing control of water flow rate and direction to improve water utilization efficiency and enhance productivity of land.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Beatrice OtienoPerkerra irrigation scheme was constructed by the colonial government in 1945 to ensure efficient water utilization, enhance soil productivity and food security. It is an open-furrow system consisting barriers constructed along a water source such as a river to direct water through a conveyance system by gravity into feeder channels to cultivated land.  Water control system is constructed between the conveyance and the feeder channels to control the direction and speed of the water.\nThis technology is suitable on fairly flat, irrigable land with reliable water sources for irrigation. Consideration of population structure is crucial in ascertaining the availability labor force in farmlands. Depending on the size and market orientation of the production system, a stable market is also an important consideration.\nIrrigated farming in the scheme is carried out in 3 seasons a year due to availability of reliable water from the permanent Perkerra River. This also ensures that land is never left idle for re-invasion of Prosopis. Activities commence with land clearance conducted at the beginning of every planting season. Prosopis on invaded farmlands are manually cut, burnt and uprooted to minimize chances of the invasive tree from coppicing. The uprooted trunk is utilized in charcoal production for commercial purposes while the small branches are used as firewood for domestic cooking.\nThe cleared land is then ploughed using a tractor to break the soil structure and provide a fine tilth for planting. This is followed by mechanized ridging to create channels and buffer furrows to convey and retain water long enough to be infiltrated into the soil.  Seeds are then sown, a joint activity carried out through farmers\u2019 cooperation. The scheme was originally specialized for bulb onions plantation but has transformed into more diversified food crops for subsistence and commercial purposes. Crops under contractual farming are seed maize, rice, sunflower, green grams, pepper and cow peas while surplus crops under irrigation include tomatoes, vegetables, water melons, subsistence maize crops and commercial fruit trees.  In addition, availability of assured market and payment has made the scheme popular for seed maize cultivation. Ongoing experimental research on a variety sweet potatoes to reduce overdependence on maize crops have also shown promising results and are likely to be recommended for implementation. During planting seasons, fallow periods are replaced by rotational cropping and crop diversification. This improves soil structure by alternating deep and shallow-rooted crops. Replacement of the crop during rotation disrupts the life cycle of disease causing organisms, thus controlling pests and diseases as well as improving crop productivity. Consequently, there is minimal application of chemical pesticides, hence reduced chances of pollution.\nThe irrigated cultivation has improved the welfare of the community by diversifying their sources of livelihood from pastoralism, enhancing food security, eradication of poverty and improving infrastructure such as access roads to the farms. It is a major source of income, directly supporting 1,625 farm households earning an approximate total net income of Ksh. 148, 192,259 Million (Perkerra scheme brief prepared by the National Irrigation board, 2017). Each household is assigned between 0.5 to 4 acres of land. This range might however be narrowed in the near future due to the increasing population in demand for the fixed land resource. The other option under consideration is to reclaim more invaded land and expand the scheme. The challenge facing this approach and is yet to be addressed is limited water resources to sustain the expansion. Lack of suitable market for non-contractual crops as well as poor pricing due to monopolization by contracting institutions is also a great setback to this technology. A good example is the abandonment of pawpaw production by farmers due to marketing problems.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Social and socio-economic|Cooperative models and aggregation|Farmer producer organizations","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1076, 1077, 1082","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|minimize pesticide use|Access to markets|access to physical marketplaces|Supply chain management|support to post-harvest handling and aggregation|Collective action and aggregation|cooperative management to improve efficiency and governance","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 1180, 912, 916, 921, 920, 926, 928, 931, 939, 942, 973, 974","readiness_level":"9.

This has led to a reduction in vegetation cover, to soil compaction, and to severe sheet and rill erosion. In 1982, one innovative land user began to set up half a hectare vineyard\/fruit plot with intensive grass\/fodder production for cut-and-carry and also a separate section above for hay making - by his own initiative. By the application of various conservation measures, within five years an area exposed to severe water erosion was converted into an area of sustainable use. Fodder and fruits are now flourishing and the natural resources of soil and water are conserved more effectively.\nPurpose of the Technology: The start of the process was fencing of the plot to keep out animals. Scrap metal and other materials from a machinery depot were used to build a 1.5 m high fence. To harvest and hold runoff water from the hillside for grapes and fruit trees, narrow backsloping terraces were constructed, each with a water retention ditch along the contour. During the initial phase, the terraces did not harvest enough water for establishment of the seedlings. So water for supplementary irrigation was carried to the plot by donkeys in old inner tubes from car tyres. Manure is applied to the plot to improve soil fertility. The manure is collected on the high pastures where the herders graze their animals during summer. The total amount of manure applied to the plot so far amounts to about 3 t\/ha over 20 years.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The establishment of such a plot is very demanding in terms of manpower. However within 5-6 years the system becomes self-sustaining and the productivity of the land is improved several times over. Following this positive experience, other households in the area have adopted the technology spontaneously, and today about 15 ha of degraded grazing land in the Varzob valley have been converted into productive fruit gardens.\nNatural \/ human environment: For the innovator, his most valuable fruits are grapes, followed by apricots, almonds and plums. He has also successfully grown mulberry, pomegranate and cherry trees. Not all the seedlings survive: the farmer considers a 40% survival rate of grape vines to be reasonable. The fruit harvest is mainly used for home consumption. However, in a good year the table grapes and apricots are sold on the market. The hay harvest, from naturally regenerated grasses and fodder plants between the fruits amounts on average to 0.2 t\/ha\/year.

It is estimated that approximately 20% of clay soils on the top soil have been washed away in recent years. In 2009 The Sustainable National Resources Management Product and Enhancement Project supported by Asia Development Bank (ADB) encouraged villagers to set up cow and forage farms. Ten cow breeding groups were established in the village. The cow farming group had used the communal land with a total 15 ha. After four years of implementation, some group members ignored their responsibilities and the group experienced a number of difficulties in both the management of the livestock and grass, which finally led to the collapse of the system. However, by 2014, one of the former members regained his interest in cow farming. He was able to rent the former 15 ha of land and he re-established the cow farm to a herd of 130 heads. At the beginning he only chose the healthiest stems of grass that remained from the old farm and replanted these. Three grass species were planted in rows on one area, namely Nepir, Guinea and Paspalum. It took thirty days to plow and prepare the land using a tractor and a labour force of more than fifty workers. For about five days, ten of these laborers had to remove the forage roots from the old fields. Generally, mid-May is the most suitable time to plant the grass as there is only a small amount of rain. Work begins by clearing the land and plowing the soil and then leaving it to dry for 15 days in order to get rid of some of the weeds and pests. During this period, some of the organic matter decays and develops into green compost which helps to improve the soil\u2019s structure. This subsequently successfully regenerates the growth of the grass as its roots are able to easily expand throughout the soil. Whilst waiting for the soil to dry fences will be constructed around the plot. Then 40 tons of manure should be transported to the field using a two-wheel tractor. After, the manure has to be distributed and plowed into the soil. At the beginning of June grass can be planted by digging holes in rows, as to place the grass suckers into the ground at a depth of 5 cm. Irrigation is unnecessary as rain is expected in June. Optionally the farmer can use a gravity fed irrigation, if necessary. The forage can be harvested around 90 \u2013 100 days after plantation. There are two options regarding the feeding of livestock: First option involves hired labourers to harvest the grass. The second option is to allow the livestock to graze freely in the field, 6 months after grass plantation. However, this can only be undertaken on a bi-weekly basis so as to allow the grass to regenerate. It is important to extract the weeds and apply organic fertilizer or green manure after the grass has been cut. Maintenance may also involve the repairing of fences. Advantages of this planting grass are the reduction of soil erosion and preventing nutrients from being washed out during heavy rains, as well as reducing soil compaction. Meanwhile the organic matter in the soil increases due to the decay of dead leaves of grass and roots. Further advantage is to grow up stronger and healthier cows. This also means that the farmers get higher household revenue from the sale of his livestock which on average amounts up to 80,000,000Kip\/annum. Family members also have more time for other household activities because cows are released in the early morning and called back in late afternoon. However, one of the disadvantages could be a reduction in the local biodiversity such as edible insects and crickets. Furthermore the availability and variety of non-timber forest products declines such as Hed Amanita hemibapha, broom grass and rattan. Wildlife numbers have also reduced as people used to find and squirrels in this region. Another challenge may be that households have limited labour power to maintain fences and the forage fields, as it is relatively expensive to hire workers at 50,000 Kip\/day. Difficulties in carrying out weeding include Nga Nam Keo.

The average annual precipitation is 1400 mm. The area is characterized with often stormy precipitation events and occasional droughts. Silty loam soils in the area are moderately deep to deep with medium soil organic matter. Area has good availability of surface water and groundwater of good drinking quality. Area has medium biodiversity without salinity and flooding problems. Sedentary agriculture with mixed or commercial agriculture is practiced with less than 10% of income from off-farm. Individual farm households are average in wealth and they are basically mechanized\/motorized. The examined farm household, as all housholds in the region has good access to all services and infrastructures. Farm is medium in scale with land owned partly by the farmer and partly leased from other private owners.\n2. Cropland area was converted to permanent grassland or pasture land by sowing of grass and by a fence as protection. Grazing is organized in a rotation system between suckler cow\u0027s pasture and paddocks.\n3. The purpose of the technology is to use the natural potential of the soils. As soils are shallow with low water holding capacity permanent grassland is much more resilient and adapted to the drought; permanent grassland needs not only less water, but as well less nutrients. Grass has the capacity to grow well after any rainfall event at any time of the growing period. During drought when, maize fields get dry, grasslands subsist and just wait until the rain falls. While maize yield is lost in drought years, grassland can sustain and nurrish animals until mid-autumn. Another advantage of grassland is its building up of organic matter in the soils.\n4. Main activities to establish the grazing fields are fences and electricity instalments together with grass sowing. Main maintenance activities are regular checking of the fence and electricity power and regular cleaning cuts to remove the weed at least once a year.\n5. Benefits are:\n(1) soils are less exposed to adverse weather conditions like drought\n(2) increase of soil organic matter\n(3) better resilience of the land user against production loss\n(4) rise of soil biodiversity\n(5) better animal welfare\n(6) land user benefit from growing customer interest for meat products.\n6. Land users like this better use of land resources, as less productive soils have gained new meaning.

These tropical moist deciduous forests are popularly known as Sal forest as the predominant species is Sal (Shorea robusta). The importance of Sal forests lies in the fact that these are the only natural forest resources of the central and northern parts of Bangladesh where the majority of the country\u2019s population lives. Historically, the agrarian rural people around the forests have been heavily dependent on Sal forests for their livelihood. Until the beginning of the 20th century, Sal forests existed as a large continuous belt with rich biological resources but increasing pressure from population growth has been placed on them ever since. Most of the Sal forests have either become degraded in quality or reduces by conversion to agricultural land.\nThe Forest Department introduced coppice management with natural regeneration in Sal forest that have a rotation of 20-30 years to regain the forest structure and biomass. Coppicing is a traditional method of forest management, which exploits the capacity of tree species to put out new shoots from their stump or roots if cut down. Due to the fact that shoots perform better than seedlings, because they obtain water, nutrients and carbohydrates from a well-developed root system of the parent tree, they are more resilient to human disturbances that affect tree growth and survival. As new growth emerges after a number of years, the coppiced tree is harvested, and the cycle begins again. Therefore, coppicing is considered an ef\ufb01cient mechanism by which trees regain above-ground biomass immediately after disturbance.\nThe Gazipur Sal forest is located in lowland plain areas of the central parts of Bangladesh. The average temperature in Gazipur is 25.8 \u00b0C and the annual rainfall is 2036 mm. The area is densely populated with a population density of 2,505 per square km. The dominant land use is still agriculture, but industrialization rate is higher in the area as it is only 25km away from capital Dhaka. The Sal forest area is managed by Bangladesh Forest division. Co-management approach is introduced in some buffer areas for the coppice management of Shorea robusta with a profit-sharing ratio of 65:25 between forest department and community beneficiaries. The rest of 10% money allocated for further tree farming activities.\nNo new planting of Sal seedlings is necessary for this practice. In the first year a relatively poor-quality Sal stand of Gazipur site were selected where coppice regeneration took place from stumps. Then, the multiple shoots regenerated from the stump were singled to three best shoots per stump and the rest were harvested. These three shoots were maintained in the following years and new shoots were removed if there were any. In addition, regular weeding was needed to maintain the technology. Local community people engaged to the maintenance and surveillance activities through co-management modalities and they will get their profit share after harvesting of the mature stand.\nWhere the density of Sal stumps is between 200-400 stems\/ha, coppice management potentially protects and promotes the growth of new Sal seedling and other natural species in open areas. The native species regeneration under coppice management helps protect biodiversity value in a cost-effective manner. Coppice Sal Forests have the capacity to regenerate a rich variety of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs). The major NTFPs collected by the co-management beneficiaries include fuelwood, dry leaves for fuel, and medicinal plants. Apart from this, they also collect mushroom, tuber crops, wild fruits, cane, honey and resin from coppice forests. As the area is under permanently protected area the beneficiaries cannot harvest any timber from the stand.\nAs the artificial regeneration of Sal is difficult, the sustainable forest management can be ensured through coppice management of Sal. In Gazipur, the depleted Sal forest are now slowly regaining its health and habitats for wildlife are improving as well. These forests, which historically were seen as timber sources, are now managed for multiple products through coppice management. The forest now supports alternate income for community people and also playing important role for ecological balance of this region.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Institutional|Governance function|Partnerships|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1116, 1129, 1135, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Production|forest products and logging management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Farm management|income increase|forestry management|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation","use_cases_id":"897, 901, 916, 917, 910, 1180, 927, 918, 919","readiness_level":"7.

The corridors are regulated through the \u2018code rural\u2019 \u2013 a national law defining the land use rights of the pastoralists. Demarcation of couloirs is based on a consensual decision of all concerned interest groups. Internal couloirs are negotiated in a general on-site assembly involving all stakeholders (farmers, breeders, women\u2019s groups, local authorities). For the demarcation of external couloirs the involvement of transhumance herders and neighboring villages is indispensable. Once an agreement on the course of the couloir is achieved, demarcation with stones and\/or boundary planting with selected tree species is carried out by the local land users - with financial and technical assistance of the government or NGOs. Common species involve: Euphorbia balsamifera, Acacia spp. (A. nilotica; A. senegal); and Faidherbia albida. Management committees at the community level draw up regulations for the management of the couloirs (maintenance and protection of vegetation). Protection of plants is achieved through dead branches (at the initial stage), daily control by forest guards, and information campaigns. The technology is a sustainable solution to the described conflicts.

The technology is used on low-slope \/ non-slope lands, which allows to ensure homogenity of moisture, reducing soil salinity in the end part of the field, increasing irrigation water productivity and crop yields\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Rustam IbragimovFurrow surface irrigation method is traditional in Uzbekistan on row crops. It is quite simple and low cost, but low efficient. According to N. Laktaev (1978), V. Sevryugin (2001), even with an optimal combination of irrigation technique elements, the coefficient of uniformity of wetting of the field area does not exceed 0.5-0.4 points. However, on lands subject to salinization, the furrow surface irrigation is preferable, as it provides downward flows of water and regulates soil salinization in the root zone. Therefore, to increase the efficiency of the irrigation water  use, it is necessary to improve irrigation along the furrows, which is especially important for flat lands with small slopes. For such conditions, furrow irrigation is recommended, which effectiveness has been proven empirically. It regulates the salt regime during the growing season, uniformly moistens the soil and reduces water losses due to the reduction of irrigation duration and the absence of discharges.\nThe forced supply of water is carried out from single output irrigators on both sides of the field. For this, a permanent irrigation network is created in the area with small surface slopes. The effectiveness of furrow irrigation of cotton on saline lands was tested in the framework of the ZEF \/ UNESCO project (2004-2006) in the Khorezm region. Year-round monitoring of the components of the water and salt regime included: measurements of precipitation and evaporation, volumes of water supply for irrigation and leaching, soil moisture in the aeration zone, depth and salinity of groundwater and salinization of the soil. As a result, savings of irrigation water by 321 m3 \/ ha (2004) and 914 m3 \/ ha (2005) were revealed. The use of counter-irrigation on the farm fields of the Khorezm region ensured a decrease in irrigation water costs by 15-30%, reducing of the salts seasonal accumulation at the end of the furrows, and an increase of cotton productivity by 30-35% (0.5 t \/ ha). Technology does not cost much. At the initial stage of implementation, there will be additional costs for high-quality field levelling and the preparation of a permanent irrigation network. The acquiring of water metering equipment (a Chipoletti portable spillway for measuring of the water flow rate in the supply sprinkler and 4 Thompson spillways for measuring flow rate in the furrows) is also necessary. In the future, to maintain the technology every year, only the maintenance of irrigation system elements will be needed.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|optimization of resource use for better production|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"916, 920, 910, 914, 897, 898, 909, 921","readiness_level":"7.

They can be grown on their own or between rows of annual and perennial crops such as maize, coffee, and fruits. The main purposes of growing cover crops are to cover the soil with low-growing vegetation, protect the soil from exposure to sun and rain, suppress weeds, improve soil fertility, supply livestock feed, and manage insect pests. Cover crops may be nitrogen fixing (if legumes), and they make productive use of spaces between crop rows, as well as controlling wind and water erosion. They also have the potential to restore soil fertility and help in climate change adaptation, as well as sequestration of atmospheric carbon above and below soil surface. Furthermore, cover crops can be fed to livestock, helping to bridge periods of shortage of feed when grazing lands are not available \u2013 which is an increasing problem because of growing population pressure and expansion of croplands. Land users give huge credit for its role as a pesticide by deterring armyworm and stalk borer when used as a border, and stopping their advance into the maize crop.\nDesmodium is an example of a leguminous cover crop, improving soil fertility via fixing atmospheric nitrogen, increasing infiltration and productive use of soil moisture, and catering for livestock via a \u201ccut-and-carry\u201d fodder system.  Desmodium is planted between rows of maize crops as well as between grass hedgerows around the farm.  For its establishment, access to desmodium seed is essential. Once established, it remains to serve as a permanent source of planting material.  Nevertheless, there are some disadvantages of desmodium: seed collection is difficult, it may trap honey bees and it can compete with the crop for light and space if allowed to grow too tall. Thus, efficient management of desmodium is essential.  Nevertheless, as part of an agro-ecological intervention, cover crops like desmodium deliver multiple benefits to resource-poor farmers and can be viewed as an investment in improving soil fertility as well as soil health. Overall, cover crops improve productivity, and help ensure yield stability and contribute to a healthier ecosystem.COMMENTS:The land user is a member of the the ISFM+ implementing farmers group and recently evolved to the Agro ecology since the kebele is an agroecology site.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1197, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|minimize pesticide use|livestock monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 910, 914, 916, 917, 918, 919, 921, 922, 926, 905","readiness_level":"9.

To date they have been worked using conventional tilling without herbicides: most of the work is done mainly in the winter, followed by two or three sessions in spring aimed at controlling the growth of weeds, which is conditioned by the spring rains.\nThe technology is based on minimum tillage and the use of Secale cereale L and Brachypodium distachyon (L.) as cover crops to protect the soil against erosion and to increase the organic matter.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purposes of this technology are to fight against erosion and water runoff and to increase soil organic matter.\nIndirectly this technology contributes to increase biodiversity in the vineyards and it could have some positive effects on wine quality (related to the content of sugar and poliphenoles) as proved by some authors (Dry et al., 2001).\nCover crops usually increase the soil moisture but on the other hand, along the summer, the cover crops and the vines are in competition for the scarce water available in the area.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The plant cover in the centre of the rows was sown in mid-November, following the copious rains in the autumn of 2006. A minimum tillage (15cm depth) is carried out before sowing. The seeding rates were 70 kg\/ha for rye, Secale cereale L., and 40 kg\/ha for purple false brome, Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv. This latter cover had to be reseeded by hand since the seeds have to be buried at a very low depth. It sprouts in late winter or early spring and by late June it is already mature and dry, at which point it self-sows and it sprouts spontaneously again the following autumn. The Secale cover has to be cut in spring and re-sown in late autumn.\nOnce sown, the resulting vineyard was divided into alternating rows with  three treatments: bare soil with traditional tilling, rows covered with Secale and rows covered with Brachypodium.\nThe maintenance activities consist of no tillage in winter and conservation of natural cover crops until spring.\nNatural \/ human environment: The area is at an altitude of 800 m, in a semiarid Mediterranean climate where the recorded annual rainfall is below 400 mm and the average annual temperature is 14 \u00baC, with very hot and occasionally stormy summers and very cold winters. It rains primarily in spring and autumn.\nThe farmland is predominantly dry, especially where olives and vines are planted. Oaks (holm, Portuguese and hermes) can be found in nearby wild areas and in abandoned terrains. The study focused on the area of Campo Real  in the southeast of Madrid, in the centre of Spain. The vineyard covers an area of some 2 ha of rolling hills and is located on top of  limestone marl.\nThe farmer is the owner of the land where the technology was implemented as well as he owns other plots.

The coastal populations are mostly poor and some of them are landless with livelihoods connected to agriculture, fishing, shrimp farming, salt farming etc. Past devastating cyclones have killed thousands of people and destroyed homes and infrastructure. Creation of green shelter-belts, including mangrove and non-mangrove plantations, reduces the vulnerabilities and hazards related to extreme weather events like cyclones and storm surges.  Afforestation along coastal areas is usually cheaper and ecologically more beneficial than other measures and serves to conserve biodiversity and stabilize newly accreted land. As a general guideline, a shelter-belt protects an area over a distance up to its own height on the windward side and up to 10 times its height on the leeward side, depending on the strength of the wind.\nThe current sustainable land management practice takes particular account of the Jhau plantation along the coastline of Himchari National Park of Cox\u0027s Bazar. Jhau (Casuarina equisetifolia) is one of the most promising non-mangrove species for creating shelter-belts and the Bangladesh Forest Department has been planting them in raised coastal lands and embankments since the 1990s. Casuarina equisetifolia is an evergreen tree with a finely branched, feathery crown and usually growing around 35 meters tall. It is fast growing, salt tolerant, grows in sand and can also tolerate occasional inundation by sea water at extremely high tides. Many areas where the species naturally occurs are susceptible to tropical cyclones, and its general tolerance to strong winds has encouraged its use in protective planting. The most common uses of C. equisetifolia are for coastal sand dune stabilization, shelter-belts, land reclamation and erosion control. The wood is hard and used for house posts, rafters, electric poles, tool handles, etc. It has been called \u2018the best firewood in the world\u2019 and also produces high-quality charcoal.\nCoastal plantation with Jhau is a soft adaptation measure that has significantly contributed to reduce the loss of lives and properties against tropical cyclones and storm surges in the coastal areas. This species can be planted in coastline, roadside, embankment and marginal lands for creating dense vegetation, which can function as windbreak and combat tidal surges. The spacing used in this shelter-belt plantation along the coastline of Himchari National Park is 2m x 2m and 2500 trees are planted per hectare area. The examined shelter-belt plantations are approximately 1.5km long and 150m wide. The major activities required to establish the plantation were: nursery development (seed collection, site clearing, leveling and fencing, drainage arrangement, bed preparation, making overhead shed, poly-bag preparation, potting seeds, manuring, irrigation, weed control), site preparation (prepare plantation site map with GPS, weeding, marking pit location with sticks, carrying of seedlings to the site) and tree planting (digging of planting holes, tying up of plants with stick for support, application of fertilizers and compost). Weeding and vacancy filling were the maintenance activities which required up to three years after plantation establishment. All those activities carried out by the forest department with the financial help from world bank project fund. The local communities were involved as paid labour for nursery development, plantation and maintenance activities. Local people can only collect fuel wood from the plantation as its soul purpose is to act as shelter-belt from cyclones and tidal surge.\nAs the plantation site is on the coastline and beside the Himchari National Park, it turns to a tourist spot now for its scenic beauty. Local people involved with various sorts of tourist oriented small-scale business here e.g. parasailing, boating, restaurant, cottage industries, shops, etc. Though the initial establishment of Jhau stand need intensive care, it  is functioning as a good wind breaker and combating with tidal surge along with creating alternate livelihood opportunities for local people.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Flood mitigation strategies|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1204, 1198","use_cases":"Farm management|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|forestry management|income increase","use_cases_id":"910, 1154, 916, 918, 917, 927, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

To restore pastures in the area surrounding the Katon-Karagay village, a technology to improve pastures through sowing perennial legumes (sainfoin, lucerne, eastern galega), cereals (smooth brome, orchard grass, Russian wild rye), forage crops and mixed grasses was developed within the framework of the GEF\/SGP \u201cOrganization of Katon-Karagay Village Pasture Management to Minimize Land Degradation\u201d Project. The introduction of this technology allows for an increase in pasture productivity, and an improvement in the quality and weight of livestock. This leads to an increase in the income and improvement in the quality of life for the local population. The technology was applied to an area of 80 ha surrounding the Katon-Karagay village, where previously intensive livestock grazing was practiced. At present this area is under a short-term lease (5 years) to the \u0022Mametek\u0022 Farmers\u2019 Association (FA). The technology was introduced within the framework of the approach on \u0022Pasture management through restoration of distant stock-breeding system and drastic improvement of pastures\u0022, in which \u0022Mametek\u0022 FA is one of the key parties. Practice is documented in the frame of CACILM.\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose was to restore the degraded area surrounding Katon-Karagay village for later use as a pasture, to secure perennial grass and cereal seed production for the restoration of degraded pastures and to improve pasture productivity in other areas.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The establishment and maintenance activities include fencing of the area to prevent the destruction of crops by livestock. Soil processing - plowing to a depth of 25-27 cm with subsequent harrowing and evening. Spring sowing of cover crops (barley, oats) to a depth of 5-10 cm. After cover crops are sown, perennial grasses and cereals should be sown to a depth of 2-3 cm. They should be sown in the same area as the one-year crops. One-year crops and perennial forage crops should be mown annually in autumn. The seeds for sowing in other areas should be collected in the 3 years after sowing. The seeds are intended for the further restoration of pastures in other areas. To utilize the technology the following initial activities should be conducted: purchase of materials (poles, wire), soil processing (leasing of tractors and seeders), purchase of seeds for sowing, leasing of machinery for mowing and taking away the hay. The work should be conducted by the farmers\u2019 association with an additional labour force for a period of up to 15 days. Since the grasses are perennial, there is no need for further activities, only nitric fertilizers should be applied from time to time.\nNatural \/ human environment: The project area is situated in an inter-mountain valley at a height of about 1000 m.

Unsustainable use of pastures is the main cause of pasture degradation. There is an imbalance in the stocking level: some places are undergrazed, others suffer from excessive grazing.  The difference in the amount of summer and winter feed stocks leads to overgrazing of some winter pastures.\nWhen creating improved autumn-winter pastures, the selected area is divided into alternating strips of 12 m and 25 m width.  The 12 m width spaces are left in the case of poor grass, and the 25 m width spaces are left  in case when the state of grass pastures is moderate, but it needs to be enriched with species for autumn-winter grazing. There are prospective varieties of desert forage plants used to increase pasture productivity: Haloxylon aphyllum, Kochia prostrata, Ceratoides eversmanniana, Salsola orientalis, Aellenia subaphylla, Agropyron desertorum, Atriplex undulata. Soil preparation includes plowing with simultaneous harrowing or rolling with ring rollers, or leveling. Plowing reduces the competitive ability of natural vegetation and stimulates soil moisture accumulation and conservation. The best time for plowing is the autumn-winter period after rainfall, when the soil is moistened to the depth of plowing. On light and medium-sized soils without strong swarding, plowing can also be carried out in summer. The sowing period is of particular importance in the conditions of deserts and semi-deserts. The following sowing periods are recommended for wild forage plants: Artemisia, Aellenia subaphylla - from late November to mid January; Kochia prostrat\u0430,  Salsola \u043erientalis -  mid December to mid February. It is recommended to sow in rainy weather, under snow or in the snow. Sowing is carried out by traditional grain seeders, as well as grain-grass seeders, with row spacing of 60 cm. To improve flowability, the seeds are mixed with manure and dry sand in a ratio of 1:5. Seeding in the soil is done by rolling ring rollers. The seeding rate is: Haloxylon aphyllum -5kg \/ Salsola Richteri 10-12kg \/ ha, Aellenia subaphylla 8-10kg\/g, Kochia prostrat\u0430 3kg \/ ha, Salsola \u043erientalis 6-7 kg \/ ha, Artemisia 3-4 kg \/ ha, Camphorosma 3-4 kg \/ ha,  Poa bulbosa 3 kg \/ ha. The additional sowing of perennial forage crops will increase the productivity of pastures by 2-3 times. In the first year of vegetation, plants of these species produce 1.5-1.6 C \/ ha of dry mass, in the second year-2.2-3.5 C \/ ha of dry mass and about 0.4 C \/ ha of seeds.

Kochia prostrat\u0430, Salsola \u043erientalis, Atriplex undulata can be mow down 2 times during the year. The sheep grazing at permissible load can be done in spring and autumn to get easy-to-eat forage by autumn. If the vegetation cover is used for 70-75% the possibility of self-regeneration of pastures remains and plant communities are able to regenerate themselves for a long time (20-25 years). Ripe seeds are carried by wind, animals and spread over large areas. The creation of improved long-term pasture agrophytocenoses for various purposes (pasture, hay) and terms of use (spring-summer, autumn-winter, year-round) will allow cattle grazing on such pastures throughout the year.COMMENTS:The Technology is implemented in degraded pasture areasSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Native species utilization|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)|Species diversification","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1201, 1199, 1200","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|improved plant varieties|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 902, 916, 917, 921, 909","readiness_level":"7.

In this case study the land user has been practicing crop diversification with eleven different crop varieties.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Navin CheaCrop diversification entails simultaneously growing two or multiple varieties of crops in a particular place with the application of crop rotation techniques and\/or intercropping. The selection of the crop varieties will depend on the purpose of the land user. In general, a diversity of crops will provide a range of benefits such as food security, nutritional diversity, income generation, soil conservation, pest and disease control as well as adaptation to climate change (CGIAR, 2017, Makate et al, 2016, MoEYS\u0026amp; VVOB Cambodia, 2013).\nMrs. Prum Thon has been cultivating a diversity of crops with the application of rotation techniquesfor about 10 years, which involves exchanging an entire crop in a particular row. This means that cultivation can take place throughout the year without having to leave the land fallow. At the time of the interview eleven different crops had been cultivated including spring onions, anise basil, Cambodian mint, bok choy, choy sum, escarole, mint, long beans, cucumbers, bitter melons and lettuce. Almost all of these crops have an average lifespan of three months, except for the anise basil which can grow for one or two years depending on the way it is cultivated. After she has harvested a particular crop, she will then rotate this crop row with a new distinctive crop species. For instance after having harvested spring onions she will then plant mint in that row, and in the row where she was previously growing mint, she will rotate that with either spring onions or cucumbers.\nThe practice of crop diversification whilst at the same time rotating the crop in each of the rows aims to achieve the following main objectives:\nCrop diversification enables the farmer to generate a daily income to offset her daily expenses which thereby becomes a means of improving her livelihood. Growing a diversity of crops can also enable her to meet a variety of market demands  and generate a high daily income. If a farmer grows only one crop specie she can usually earn about 15,000 Riel per day, but if she plants four crop species such as anise basil, bok choy, long beans and cucumbers she can increase her income to about 20,000 Riel per day, However if she grows one more specie such as lettuce or grows eleven different crops, she would be able to increase her income up to 40,000 or 80,000 Riel per day. The practice of crop diversification enables her to generate an income on a daily basis. \nCrop diversification with the rotation of the crop in each row after the harvest could assist in reducing soil degradation. According to her experience and observations each crop absorbs different nutrients from the soil. If one row is repeatedly used to cultivate spring onions, they tend not to flourish so well and the roots have a tendency to decay. However if they are rotated with another crop and the spring onions are then grown in another row, they are able to thrive and the roots and stems are less likely to spoil. Crop diversification also has other functions as the cover crops help to reduce soil degradation through expose to sunlight, maintain soil moisture, make the soil less compact and add beneficial micro-organisms to the soil. In addition crop diversification can control pests especially the practice of growing companion plants such as herbs or spring onions as this can prevent crops from being damaged by pests.\nThe use of this technology assists in improving livelihoods, reduces migration because she does not need to move in order to find a job in another location, and enables her to generate a daily income. In addition this technology is able to reduce the risk of crop failure resulting from damage by pests and insects.Furthermore it reduces the risks associated with changes in market demand as the farmer produces a diversity of crops and also it prevents and reduces soil degradation. In order to effectively use this technology there needs to be sufficient water supply such as a river, stream, well or pond.This enables the land user to grow crops throughout the year round and reduces damage of crops as the result of unpredictable adverse climate conditions such as changes in rainfall, or the occurrence of drought.COMMENTS:It is spread over an area of 2700 square meters.Spring onion, anise basil, Cambodian mint, bok choy, escarole, choy sum, mint, long bean, cucumber, bitter melon, lettuce.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1200, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|minimize pesticide use|plant health|optimization of resource use for better production|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 914, 916, 918, 921, 926, 906, 909, 917","readiness_level":"9.

On steep slopes, where  cassava plots are intercropped with stylosanthes or brachiaria, no-till cultivation with crop residues prevents erosion during rainy periods.\nThis technology protects the soil against erosion and maintains soil fertility, which improves annual yields. The plant cover left on the plots facilitates infiltration of rainfall and reduces evapotranspiration. It can also reduce weed growth, and improve porosity while encouraging the development of living soil organisms. In the case of leguminous crops, the decomposition of their roots and nodules releases nitrogen that can benefit subsequent crops. Crop residues can be used as seedbed litter for no-till crops, or as green manure through ploughing when plant remains are buried.\nWeeding before seeds are produced is essential for no-till sowing or burying crop residues, especially in rich soils (baiboho). Failure to weed in a timely manner may compel farmers to burn residues to prevent weeds from proliferating in the next crop.\nCrop residues also compete with livestock feed, as leguminous residues can be sold, especially during the rainy season. Cattle grazing on crop residues is widespread, and residue owners are forced to accept this to avoid conflicts with their neighbours. Additionally, plot owners themselves may feed their own cattle with the residues during the dry season. This is why this technique requires good management of forage resources, for example through fodder production.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|animal production|livestock monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 917, 918, 919, 922, 910, 914, 909, 899, 905","readiness_level":"7.

Crop residue (CR) management is integral to soil health:  it yields multiple benefits such as mitigating the risks of soil loss to water erosion, reducing the decomposition of organic matter and storing extra carbon. It also increases the fertility status of degraded soils and helps to improve soil structure and moisture properties. Degraded soils are at risk of tillage, water, and wind erosion. Soils degrade quickly when not covered and when no effort is made to increase organic matter levels or improve soil structure. Crop residue management plays an important role in arresting soil degradation and improving soil properties, and eventually increasing crop production. Therefore, it has positive economic and ecological functions. The aim of applying this technology is to improve soil fertility, reduce soil acidity and demands for synthetic fertilizers. Overall, crop residue management allows land users to sustainably use their land over a long period without losing its productive potential. In this part of Ethiopia, land users used to leave maize and millet stover in the fields but this is challenged by the prevalence of free (open access) grazing. Thus, controlling grazing is one prerequisite to ensuring adoption of the technology. Monocropping  also reduces biomass production. Land users appreciate the extra grain yields from crop residue-rich farms. CR management also retains moisture and enables early tillage operations. In summary, the application of appropriate CR management provides multiple benefits. It mitigates the risks of erosion, reduces excessive mining of CR, reduces the rate of decomposition of organic matter, increases the fertility status of degraded soils, and increases crop production and sustainable productivity.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 922, 919, 910, 914, 909, 917","readiness_level":"7.

The optimum amount for a significant mulching effect is 1.5 to 2 t\/ha (corresponding to 2 to 3 stems\/m\u00b2). Producers spread the stalks immediately after harvest (October-November).\nThe aim of this technique is to:\n-reduce losses of fine soil particles;\n-return a portion of the nutrients extracted back to the soil;\n-facilitate infiltration, conservation and reduce evaporation of water from the soil;\n-keep soil loose;\n-conserve biodiversity;\n-increase crop yields;\n-reduce weed proliferation and herbicide use; and\n-reduce production costs by cutting down on weeding labour.\nThe application methods vary based on whether producers intend to plough the soil or opt for minimum tillage. In the case of minimum tillage, residues are spread on the soil post-harvest to limit removal by grazing animals. Alternatively, immediately after harvesting, producers mow the stalks and arrange them in furrows at the onset of the dry season.\nFor those choosing to plough, the soil is covered with straw or harvest residues, then the cut crop residues (stover) are spread on the ground. Therefore, at the start of the season, producers plough their plots. \u201cFlat ploughing\u201d involves ploughing the plot with the initial rains, followed by cross-ploughing 15 days later to bury the stalks. Ridge ploughing, on the other hand, requires ridging the plot by returning the soil over the residues placed in furrows.\nWhen using tractors, producers prefer to use straight tips and open-wing shares for ploughing depths of 15-20cm. To ensure the sustainability and scalability of the technique, the establishment of firebreaks is recommended.\nProducers report varying results, reaching up to double yields in some cases, contingent on the level of soil degradation. For cotton producers, yields fluctuate between 1.5 to 2.7 tons per hectare with the use of cotton residues, and on less degraded soils, can even reach 3.2 tons per hectare. Consequently, it is unsurprising that present-day producers willingly choose to preserve crop residues, which in the past were burned.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|optimization of resource use for better production|minimize pesticide use|Farm management|field management|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 917, 920, 909, 926, 910, 914, 1180, 912","readiness_level":"9.

Crop rotation mitigates the buildup of pathogens and pests that often occurs when one species is continuously cropped, and can also improve soil structure and fertility by increasing biomass from varied root structures.\nPurpose of the Technology: Crop rotation improves crop\u0027s productivity, it reduces soil erosion and enhances maximum nutrient utilization.

The technique aims to bear yield and income to the farmers when the trees do not bear fruit at young stage. Further purposes are the permanent soil cover which impede weed growth, reduces evaporation and soil erosion, and finally, in combination with drip irrigation it supports the adaptation to climate change.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Be GechkimAgroforestry is the practice of cultivating cash crops and\/or the rearing of livestock on a plot of land together with growing trees such as fruit trees, coco trees, bamboo or other trees so as to improve agricultural output and gain other benefits (MoE et al., 2016). Agroforestry plays a vital role in providing ecological and economic benefits which include the harvest of timber and cash crops, improved soil fertility, reduced chemical fertilizer and pesticide input, reduced cost, better adaptation to climate change (MoE et al., 2016), as well as a reduced risk of crop failure (FA and DANIDA, 2005).\nMr. Hour is one of the farmers who shifted from monoculture to agroforestry. He is living with his family at Saob Krom Village, Saob Commune, Preaek Prasab District,  Krati\u00e9 Province (the northeastern province of Cambodia).  On a hillside plot of 2100 square meters he has 135 mango trees planted in 9 rows with a space of 4 meters between each row and each tree. A number of different cash crops are intercropped in rotation between the rows of the mango trees which include amongst others: cucumbers, morning glory, cabbages and lettuce. The mango trees are cultivated after the land has been plowed and allowed to dry for 15 days. A dimension 0.5 meter of four-size hole with 0.5 meter deep is dug for each tree into which a 2 to 3kg mixture of cow manure, husk rice and bran that has been allowed to mature for 15 days is added. The farmer makes use of a drip irrigation system which extends to each tree and runs along the rows of the cash crops. The vegetable rows are prepared according to the season, as in the dry season ridge of the rows are 10 cm and in the rainy season they are 20 cm so as to prevent the vegetables being damaged by excessive amounts of water. Moreover, this technique does not cost much and generates income when the long-term crop is not yet ready to bear fruit. Additionally there are no negative impacts on the environment because the farmer applies liquid compost and bio-extract pesticide that he has produced on his own. The liquid compost is made up of a mixture of fish residue, bran and palm sugar mixed with water, which is then allowed to mature for around 15 days before it can be used. Meanwhile, the bio-pesticide is extracted from strong-smelling and bitter trees such as strychnine plants, yellow cheesewood, neem, boraphed and galangal. The materials are chopped into small pieces and mixed with palm sugar and water, which is then allowed to settle for at least 15 days before it is ready to be applied. In order to spray the crops, a liter of the liquid pesticide should be mixed with 25 liters of water. \nAll in all, this form of agroforestry brings a wide range of benefits. With this system, the farmer is able to generate an income from the different cash crops which can be harvested in both dry and rainy seasons especially in the first three years of the mango tree\u2019s life when they are still unproductive. It therefore helps to reduce the financial burden of running the whole farm. This technique also helps to regulate the local micro-climate with the shade provided by the mango trees, reduces evaporation and soil erosion, as well as adapts to drought conditions that have been brought on by climate change. Moreover, this practice avoids leaving a space between the trees that would otherwise enable the growth of unwanted weeds, which could also become a habitat for insects and the outbreak of diseases that lead to economic loss.\nAt first sight it may be a disadvantage that at the beginning the farmer has to raise a lot of money in order to install the drip irrigation system for example. However, once installed the system can last for many years which reduces labor costs related to irrigation. Regarding the cash crops the farmer also faces the challenge of unstable market prices. But if the prices are good and stable, the farmer is able to generate substantial income to improve the family\u2019s livelihood. Therefore, the institutions in charge need to take into account the market forces, too.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1203, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|minimize pesticide use|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 914, 916, 918, 917, 921, 926, 915, 909","readiness_level":"7.

The crop rotation usually takes place every other summer when the green house is fallow. Sorghum plants are commonly used for grain, fibre and fodder, but this technology uses plants as soil conditioners.\nPurpose of the Technology: The technology is applied as an effective agronomic measure for the increase of the productive capacity of soil, the reduction of pests (due to breaking or limiting pest cycles) and soil borne diseases and the mitigation of soil salinity. This technology mitigates and prevents soil degradation by improving the soil and subsoil structure through the deep root system of the plants (often \u003E1 m) and increasing nutrient and organic matter availability through the incorporation of the plant biomass into the soil by tilling it under. Furthermore, the improved structure of the soil leads in higher infiltration rates, mitigates the salt accumulation in the root zone and combats soil salinity, one of the main soil degradation problems in the coastal zone. The increase of workload and the demand of irrigation water during the dry summer period constitute the main drawbacks of the SLM technology.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Initially, when the main crop (tomato- Solanum lycopersicum) is removed from the green house in June, about 7 kg of Sorghum seeds per 0.1 ha are sown and incorporated in the soil by ploughing at about 4-5 cm depth. Sorghum is drought- and heat-tolerant thus the irrigation needs are minimum and depend on the respective climatic conditions. As it is used for manuring and not fodder or fruit  production, water stress conditions are favorable as the root system expands deeper in order to fulfill plant water needs thus improving the soil structure. In September, the farmer uses a branch grinder to fritter the Sorghum plants and then incorporates them in the soil by tillage.\nNatural \/ human environment: The average annual precipitation in the area is 500 mm and the climate ranges between sub-humid Mediterranean and semi-arid. Average annual temperature is 18.5 degrees C with 6 months below 18 degrees C but above 5 degrees C, thus classifying the area as subtropical. In the location where the technology is applied, land is mostly privately owned and water rights can be public, cooperative or private. The financial means of the land user applying this technology are more or less on par with those of the rest of the community.\nThis Technology was documented within the scope of FP7 RECARE Project, funded grant agreement no 603498.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.006 km2.Major cash crop: Tomato, Sorghum\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The main problem in the region is the change in the groundwater quality, caused by the exploitation and seawater intrusion, resulting in soil salinisation through irrigation.The lack of sustainable freshwater resources for irrigation results in increased production risk and agricultural inputs. Also, soil quality is reduced due to the use of brackish water for irrigation and the intensive agricultural practices.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): The reduction of soil fertility and productivity because of the over-exploitation of land and excessive use of pesticide.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|minimize pesticide use|Farm management|field management|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 918, 922, 926, 910, 914, 920","readiness_level":"7.

The owner lives in the valley far away from the plot. During the harvest, he is staying in the hills a whole week, because a daily journey to his house would take too much time. For the last three years, the farmer is cultivating Esparcet with the main aim to feed his cows. In two years, he will switch to a wheat or chickpea plot. In total, the farmer owns19 hectares of cropland, out of which the Esparcet plot accounts for 20% of his income. Next to the Esparcet plot, other farmers cultivate wheat and chickpea. In contrast to Esparcet, those plots must be protected from boars. Even though irrigation is impossible and the water point is situated far away, Esparcet grows very well because of the straight and spread-out roots. Esparcet is beneficial for the state of soil fertility and soil stabilization. Their seeds are more expensive than wheat seeds, but also result in a higher harvest. Esparcet can be harvested up to three times a year depending on water availability.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of Esparcet cultivation is fodder production for the cows. The farmer owns other plots where he cultivates wheat. Moreover, it\u2019s a good location for an Esparcet plot: Even though water is not available Esparcet maintains the soil moisture and nutrients while reducing soil erosion. Thanks to the crop rotation, the soil is in a  healthy state. Yield quantity and quality are very satisfying for the farmer.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The farmer stresses that good knowledge is needed to know where, what and how to cultivate. He learned from other farmers. Before establishing the perennial crop, he first planted a nurse crop of fodder grain in spring. Nurse crops strengthen soil stability while minimizing weed and overly sunlight. Plowing, sowing and cutting are initial as well as recurrent activities. No fertilizer and no plot guarding are needed. Initial costs when growing Esparcet are higher than for wheat, because Esparcet seeds are more expensive. Additionally, seeds of  the nurse crop are needed.\nNot to neglect is the long way from the farmers\u2019 house to the plot which takes time and fuel, but the farmers of that hillslope often give a lift to each other. Also during harvest the neighboring farmers are helping out.\nNatural \/ human environment: The plot on the hillslope is located far away from the farmer\u2019s\u2019 village Sarmaydon 2. It\u2019s situated at around 2000m asl below the hill peaks, where boars are entering. On three sides, the plot is delimited naturally by incised riverbeds which make accessibility more difficult. Due to the high altitude, there are low temperatures and high moisture. Above the Esparcet cultivation, wheat and chickpea plots are cultivated leading to off-site effects on the Esparcet plot. In the Esparcet plot, a deep rill developed originating from the wheat plot situated upslope.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.01 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The Esparcet plot is quite beneficial for soil and water properties. It is hence a good initial cultivation for future crop types. Soil stability is crucial as the plot is delimited by a riverbed on both sides. A wheat plot is located just above the Esparcet production. A rill developed in the upper plot, so that off-site effects like rill formation and sediment deposition are affecting the Esparcet plot.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Esparcet is maintaining soil stability and moisture which prevents major degradation. Several km2 got affected by washed soil form the upper part. No irrigation is possible.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Cooperative models and aggregation|Farmer producer organizations","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1076, 1077, 1082","use_cases":"Production|animal production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 898, 910, 914, 916, 921, 909, 912","readiness_level":"9.

One of the benefits is that nutrients and nitrogen will be transferred to the soil through this practice as traditionally green manure is added when crops are alternated with cereals. The practice helps to reduce the manifestation of diseases and insects that often occur when crop cultivation is repeated over a prolonged period. Crop rotation can improve the soil\u2019s structure and fertility as different nutrients are absorbed from the soil, and the plants\u2019 root systems are able to penetrate the soil at different depths (Cotheren J., 2014). Even though Cambodia has laws regarding the application of agricultural pesticides and fertilizers there are some farmers who still use them incorrectly. As an alternative, the intercropping technology can assist farmers in increasing yields and reduce crop damage by insects, whilst maintaining and improving the soil\u2019s fertility through agronomy as well as biological measures. \nMrs. Ek Chantho decided to practice crop rotation for a whole year whilst at the same time reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides because this can help her to reduce expenses. A further advantage for her is being a member of the safe vegetable growers group, as her contract with REMIC guarantees her sales of her vegetables to the company. Additionally she is able to sell any surplus safe vegetables to other traders once she has fulfilled her contractual obligations with REMIC.   The decision to practice crop rotation also helped to maintain and increase soil fertility as a little organic and semi-organic fertilizer is added instead of chemical fertilizers. Furthermore the amount of chemical pesticides has been reduced due to the practice of crop rotation. \nIn this case, long beans, luffa, winter melons, pumpkins and cucumbers were rotated on the plot. This practice helps to keep the soil fertile and the nutrients balanced as land degradation can result from the cultivation of the same crop, as it will repeatedly absorb the same nutrients. Furthermore, crop rotation also contributes to a reduction in plant diseases and prevents an increase in damage from pests as it prevents a particular crop from building up pathogens in the soil. Each farmer will grow two or three different crops at the same time and then will chose to grow other crops in the following season. However, as the choice of a farmer\u2019s particular crop is coordinated by REMIC it ensures that each farmer in turn will assist in providing diversified crops to fulfil market demand.     \nThe farmer stated that before practicing crop rotation, she mostly grew one or two crops which could be sold at a high price throughout the year. Therefore, in order to maintain her yields and prevent the crops from being damaged by insects she had to use a lot of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. However these only remained effective for a relatively short period and also increased her overheads. After having attended a course organized by Educational Concerns for Haiti Organization (ECHO), Rural Entrepreneurship \u0026amp; Market Inclusion in Cambodia (REMIC), and the Provincial Department of Agriculture she switched to crop rotation instead of cultivating one crop and to the use of organic and semi-organic fertilizers instead of chemicals. Furthermore her use of chemical pesticides also decreased as she followed standardized practices. This practice improves the soil quality, mitigates pests and diseases, reduces costs, improves income and also protects the health of producers and users. \nAs the farmers become highly efficient and the practice of crop rotation becomes sustainable they are able to improve their supply for the market. In fact, this has been successfully coordinated through REMIC\u2019s planning and contracting which ensures that there is always an adequate supply of diversified vegetables.  Moreover, ECHO collaborated to check the use of chemical fertilizers and control pesticides which managed to raise consumer confidence by ensuring there are safe vegetables for the market, which in turn allowed farmers to set a high price for their produce.COMMENTS:This technique is applied on the land of 50 x 40 m = 2000 square meters.long bean, luffa, cucumber, winter melonSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices|Integrated management systems|Social and socio-economic|New business models|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1200, 1206, 1197, 1076, 1211, 1088","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|minimize pesticide use|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 912, 914, 916, 921, 926, 917, 919, 922","readiness_level":"7.

Clay content in the soil is 15% at depths of 0-18 cm depth. Below this depth, it is above 44%. The topography comprises a hillslope with a gradient of 10-20 % and the main traditional crop rotation is oat-wheat or wheat-natural pasture. The farmers are smallholders working on their own land. The sizes of the holdings on the dryland soils vary from 5 to 20 ha.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 250 km2The legume species are: the narrow-leaf lupin (Lupinus angustifolium); Wonga (early-flowering and high-yielding narrow-leafed lupin variety), yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus); Motiv, Peas (Pisum sativum); Rocket and a fodder mixture of vetch (Vicia atropurpurea) with oats\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): In rainfed areas of the Mediterranean region of Chile, bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is mainly produced in rotation with oats (Avena sativa) and therefore N is obtained from the soil and synthetic N fertilizers applied during sowing and ploughing. These intensive crop rotations have resulted in deterioration of the physical properties and a depletion of soil fertility as a result of the drastic reduction in organic matter content of these soils.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Species diversification|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1200, 1197, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|animal production|Farm management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 909, 922, 899, 910, 912, 918, 917","readiness_level":"7.

However most rotation systems are confined to time limits of six years or less, providing a succession of spring (generally maize, soybean, sorghum) and winter crops (wheat, rapeseed, barley). Legumes play a pivotal role on crop rotation due to their richness in protein for both man and breeding. Using legumes in the crop rotation favour the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen and bind it into the soil with a significant increase of soil fertility.\nPurpose of the Technology: Crop rotation has the ability to control weeds and break pest cycles reducing the use of pesticides. Diversification of crop production increases soil and ecosystem biodiversity promoting the stability of agricultural systems. The introduction of legumes in crop rotation enhances nutrient availability and generally soil quality.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Crop rotation can be adjusted to the needs of farmers and can be adopted without significant investments and further costs. A typical crop rotation provides for the succession of deep-rooting crops (e.g. maize), winter wheat and finally soybean, which contribute to the re-establishment of soil fertility. Moreover the system allows a better distribution of labour throughout the year.\nNatural \/ human environment: Crop rotation has many agronomic and environmental benefits compared with monoculture cropping. The increase of soil and agro-ecosystems biodiversity has positive effect on its resilience, promoting its capacity to respond to natural and anthropogenic perturbation.   From an environmental point of view, the introduction of legumes favours a reduction of chemical inputs, with significant benefits for surface and groundwater quality.COMMENTS:Main crops: maize, wheat, soybean, alfalfa, sugar beet.\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soils in the low Venetian plain of the Veneto region generally suffer from a loss of soil organic matter (SOM) that is strongly affected by their natural texture and climatic conditions. Moreover, in the last 50 years intensive tillage practices contributed to a further SOM decrease estimated at 0.02-0.58 t\/ha\/y of carbon and high intensive monoculture practices implied oversimplification of agro-ecosystems and decline of soil biodiversity.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Decrease of productivity. However to date, few farmers have adopted conservation practices in order to reduce a decline of soil fertility and water quality, symptom of poor perception of the problem.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1197, 1200, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|minimize pesticide use|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 921, 926, 918, 919, 922, 920","readiness_level":"9.

In the past, it was based on subsistence cultivation and especially on extensive breeding outside the farm. The cultivation practice mostly applied was barley monoculture. Nowadays, crop rotation is more and more diversified (use of other cereal species and mainly legumes). Because of land degradation on forest pasture, farmers increasingly use their farm land for fodder or legume production such as oats and lupin. White lupins were introduced in the region during the colonial era (1912-1956), through individual initiatives with no external support. The advantages of lupin cultivation are its ability to grow on poor and stony soils and, like other leguminous crops, it does not need nitrogen fertilizers because of its ability to fix nitrogen from the air, which reduces the costs. Additionally, lupin does not require much water (a minimum of 350 mm per year is sufficient). Considering the importance of pastoral activity in the production system of the Sehoul district, this technology meets the expectations of the population as follows. Firstly, there is improvement of fodder production. Lupin is a leguminous crop which can be eaten by ruminants either as green fodder or as grain. Secondly, there is soil improvement through a better structure, an increased soil organic matter content and better nitrogen retention that can be used for the next cultivation. Thirdly, there is a better soil cover because lupin is an invasive plant with efficient roots for finding nutrients, which allows its cultivation on poor soils.\nThe lupin cultivation technique consists of the following: spreading the seed in October-November, and possibly until mid-December. Early sowing shows good yields, because cold temperatures cause early blossoming. For white lupin, sowing density is about 100 kg\/ha. Ploughing (20-25 cm deep ploughing is sufficient) to bury the seed is performed with a swing plough and two mules on slopes, and with a metallic plough or a tractor on plains. No weeding or fertilization activities are required because of the lupin\u0027s good nitrogen fixation capacity. However, an additional second or third ploughing can improve the harvest, but is often constrained by a lack of means. A first grazing is allowed in March but afterwards it is left so that it can recover again. Harvesting is done manually with sickles in August and residues are grazed again. Seed production is 8-10 quintals\/ha, biomass is 3000 kg\/ha.\nThis technology is applied on plateau margins with steep slopes, where traditional small-scale land use includes predominantly winter crop cultivations (wheat and barley) and secondary spring food cultivations (broad beans, chickpea, maize). On the plateau, bigger and better maintained farms perform irrigated cultivation with ground water. The cork oak forests are coveted as pasture land and firewood source and therefore they are regarded as important for their free natural fodder resources. Pasture land (except forests) covers a small area (12% of the Sehoul area) because of land appropriation and cultivation. Only the collective and the fallow lands are now used as pasture lands and generally show important and alarming degradation processes.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 2 km2.\nThe surface occupied by fodder legumes has declinedMain crops (cash and food crops): Bl\u00e9 tendre, l\u00e9gumineuses, f\u00e8ve, ma\u00efs, lupin Orge\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Decrease of productivity, continued exploitation on poor land leading to sealing and crusting, poor soils, cultivation with low ground cover, soil depletion, decrease of fertility and organic matter\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Decrease of productivity, sealing and crusting\nFuture (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Cropland: Ca: Annual cropping\nLivestock is grazing on crop residuesSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Integrated management systems|Native species utilization|Traditional and indigenous practices|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)|Species diversification","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1197, 1201, 1206, 1199, 1200","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 898, 916, 921, 922, 917, 910, 914, 909","readiness_level":"7.

Farmers typically have 3-4 cows on about 2-3 hectares for both milk consumption and sales. The landowner interviewed did not formerly adhere to best practices: cows were grazed in woodlands, and water and supplementary feed were not provided as needed. Housing was inadequate. Farm waste wasn\u2019t properly recycled.  The farm is located on steep land without adequate soil conservation for annual crops and tea. There was heavy dependence on chemical fertilizer. As a consequence, milk production was below average and crop yields had declined. Besides, there was reservoir pollution due to effluent washed downslope.\nNew technology was developed to increase milk and crop production by integrating animal\u2013crop management strategies while enhancing nutrient circularity within the farm, and improving soil productivity and environmental quality.\nThe landowner was first enrolled in the Rehabilitation of Degraded Agricultural Land Project (RDALP) of the UN\u2019s FAO in 2018.  The first priority was soil conservation for the steep areas under tea. SLM practices thus combined contour cropping and bunding. Following this, an integrated crop-livestock system was initiated. The RDALP and Fonterra Pvt. Ltd. helped the landowner to build a modern cowshed with infrastructure to provide feed and water. Thereafter, cows were stall-fed: grazing was completely stopped. Cow manure is collected and stored in heaps for 2-3 weeks before incorporating into soils.  In the same shed, compost is prepared by mixing manure with crop residues and kitchen\/ homegarden waste. Cattle urine and wastewater is directed to a cement tank where it is mixed with specific types of leaves; it is fermented and applied as liquid fertilizer and biopesticide. Manure is used mainly for fast-growing vegetables, while compost is applied to annuals, particularly at planting, and to tea once every three months.  Liquid fertilizer is applied to tea seven days before harvesting.\nThis package requires adequate land for a cattle shed, and for a recycling system to prepare compost and liquid fertilizers. In addition, there must be enough labour for the whole process. The key inputs include materials for the shed, associated infrastructure, and a sprayer to apply liquid fertilizers.\nThe major benefit is recycling waste to generate useful products \u2013 while ensuring circularity of nutrients between crop and animal production systems: thus supporting a \u201cbioeconomy\u201d. Soil conservation practices and the nutrient sources described have improved soil fertility and productivity for overall sustainability.

Miscanthus is a perennial warm-season grass used as a commercial energy crop. The plant is a sterile hybrid, unable to produce viable seed, vegetative propagation being by rhizomes, therefore reducing the risk to become invasive. Its special type of photosynthesis (C4) implies the return of the nutrients in the rhizomes during the cold season. As temperatures cool in the fall, the dark green foliage fades to buff and drops, leaving the stems which are the most important commercial part of Miscanthus. Regarding cropping on contaminated soils, research has shown that the amount of heavy metals uptaken by Miscanthus is extremely low, making the plant unsuitable for phytoextraction but allowing it to be used for green energy or in various other fields like pulp and paper industry, without any risk. Miscanthus sinensis gigantheus stands for an alternative crop, from which an annual income can be obtained, instead of food crops and fodder that can represent a risk for human and animal consumption in areas with soils contaminated with heavy metals.\nThe aim of this technology is to assure a sustainable use of polluted soils with heavy metals through cultivation of energy crops with economic value and very few risks for humans, animals and environment. Studies of Miscanthus sinensis gigantheus behaviour on contaminated soils with heavy metals showed that very small amount of Pb (Lead) and Cd (Cadmium) were detected in the upper parts of the plants. In comparison, higher amounts of heavy metals is being retained at root level in rhizomes, which in time will decrease when root system will develop deeper, in less affected soil horizons as roots can reach 2-3 m in depth. The applied technology increases overall soil quality in terms of organic matter, nutrients and structure. Miscanthus cropping enhances the nutrients cycle in the plant\u2013soil system. As a result of the high input of leaves, rhizomes and roots, the alluvial sandy loam soils, on which Miscanthus is currently croped, can benefit of increased organic carbon amount.\nThe establishment phase takes place on arable land (annual cropland) which after implementation will become a permanent cropland with perennial (non-woody) cropping, as the crop has the potential to be in the ground for at least 15 years. Miscanthus cropping technique consists of the following: weeding the site in July-August by spraying herbicides for controlling perennial weeds, deep ploughing in October-November to improve subsoil structure and soil aeration possible affected by compaction or hardpan, harrowing in February-April to ensure an adequate seedbed for rhizomes and planting in March-May. Early planting is being recommended as it takes advantage of spring time soil moisture and allows an extended first season of growth. The operation can be made using a modular potato planter or specialized planter like Miscanthus ETPM4. The planting rate is 10 000 rhizomes per hectare in order to provide a good crop density required to achieve optimal yields from year three onwards and effective weed suppression through competition. Rhizomes need to be planted at a depth of 8-15 cm and at 1m x 1m wide spacing. The crop is harvested annually during February-March, typically with conventional farm machineries or specialized ones like Miscanthus CRM Harvesting Cropper. The crop needs 3 to 4 years to reach a mature yield between 15-18 t\/ha. The technology requires mechanized agricultural operations and investments in specialized equipment, if necessary.\nThe technology is applied mainly on alluvial sandy loam soils (Fluvisols), with deep depths, on low lands with flat-gentle slops (0-5%), placed in valley floors\/floodplains. The climate is temperate, semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall between 550-600 mm. The plots cropped with Miscanthus are privately owned but leased. Size of crop land where the technology is applied is usually small up to 2 ha. The farmers receive agricultural subsidies and the production system is mechanized and market oriented.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.14 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soil contamination with heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn).\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Soil contamination with heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn).SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Bioremediation and phytoremediation|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Harvesting and processing equipment|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 994, 1000, 1188, 1191, 1192, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|equipment management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 921, 922, 919, 917, 914, 915, 912, 913","readiness_level":"7.

Land degradation due to salinization affects half of the irrigated lands of Uzbekistan. Due to insufficient measures to combat salinization, the most  salted areas are being withdrawn from agricultural use, and the land use type changes to abandoned lands. The productivity of low agricultural potential  lands could be improved by introducing new alternative crops. Indigofera (Indigofera tinctoria) is recommended as a way to restore and improve saline degraded lands. In addition, the natural indigo dye is synthesized in its aerial parts, which is in demand on the world market.  Studies in the framework of the UNESCO \/ ZEF project Bonn \/ Urgench University (Urgench State University) have shown that the Indigofer successfully grows on saline degraded lands and helps to restore their fertility. A group of scientists led by prof. A. Ergashev investigated the issues of seed production and marketing, and worked out the technology of growing Indigophera on degraded and arable lands.  With the support of the project, a highly productive salt-resistant variety \u201cFiruz-1\u201d was created. The new variety was tested under the ADB \/ CACILM \/ SLM project and convincing results were obtained.  In the conditions of Karakalpakstan, this variety produces 35 t \/ ha of biomass, from which about 110 kg of indigo paste can be extracted. On the European market, 1 kg of indigo powder costs about 80-240 Euros, on the domestic market - 100-130 thousand soums. The benefits are a good motivation for farmers to use this crop to restore degraded soils. Plant residues from dye extraction can be used as a \u201cgreen fertilizer\u201d rich in nitrogen.\n Agricultural technology for Indigofers cultivation includes:\n1. Soil flushing (1-3 thousand m3 \/ ha)\n2. Manure application (15\u201320 t \/ ha) and amophos  application  200 kg \/ ha\n3.Plowing to a depth of 25\u201335 cm, microplanning and surface leveling\n4.

The cost of Indigofers cultivation is the same as for growing other legumes, except for the difference in the seeds price. Total cost amount is 980 USD \/ ha (2012). The averadge income from the sale of indigo pigment is about 20 thousand USD\/ ha, in case indigofer is grown on degraded lands, and about 6 thousand USD\/ ha, in case of arable land. Due to the ability of the culture to fix nitrogen, the soil is enriched with natural nitrogen, respectively, the need for fertilizer is reduced.  The process of obtaining dye does not require special equipment, special knowledge and high costs.

Soil erosion occurs along riverbanks, with the end effect of gradually widening the river bed. It can be noted that the river banks in Vangyang village have already eroded by two meters which has resulted in the loss of agricultural land that was previously used to cultivate bananas and sugarcane. In order to counteract this development some of the land users initiated the planting Bambusa oldhamii on riverbanks in 2007. This strain of bamboo was selected because people could observe that the natural bamboo forest growing on opposite side of the river to their land experienced minimal soil erosion as the deep root system was able to successfully secure the soil along these stream banks. On top, Bambuse oldhamii has delicious shoots (which are consumed by land users) and less thorns compared to other wild bamboo species.\nThe application of this technology involves the following:\n\u2022 The site should be selected along the stream banks especially where the risk of erosion is occurring. Bamboo should be planted approximately 3 meters from the edge of the bank. Bamboo is grown to protect the bank on one side of the stream from soil erosion whilst the other side of the stream is protected by natural bamboo species.\n\u2022 Land preparation involves the clearance of bush around the planting pits.\n\u2022 Bamboo rhizomes (Bambusa oldhamii) should be gathered locally from the parent plants. This should amount to approximately 120 healthy one-year old rhizomes each having a considerable number of feeder roots with a length of 60 to 70cm.\nForty holes measuring 50cm x 50cm and 50 cm depth should be dug in a row leaving a gap of 5 meters between each hole along the stream bank when the bamboo\u2019s rhizome grow up it will be cover the gap for few meters from pits ( it will take about 4-5 years). After the land has been prepared 2-3 bamboo rhizomes should be replanted in each of the holes. The refilling of the holes with soil and watering should take about one day. Planting can be undertaken in January (dry season) because soil texture in dry season is less sensitive to erosion. This is a suitable time for bamboo as the roots will propagate faster. In the dry season watering needs to be done twice a week until the rhizomes establish new roots and stems. Generally, the bamboo will grow 4-5 new stems during the first year after having been replanted, but at this stage it is still unable to protect the banks from erosion. Some vegetation around the pits has been cleared before replanting and leave some vegetation on the edge to minimize erosion when the bamboo trees still young. When the bamboo is about 2-3 years old, it will be able to grow up to three times the amount of additional stems compared to its output in the first year. At this time the bamboo\u2019s root system is able to expand more widely and deeply which helps to bind the soil and thereby it protects the stream banks from erosion during high water levels. (They left the bush and some vegetation on the edge of the stream, clearance of bush around the planting pits only) . Bamboo has multiple benefits: In fact, the older bamboo is able to provide a greater amount of protection and the bamboo shoots can either be consumed or sold by the land owners. Furthermore the bamboo culms can be used or sold for the manufacture of a variety of handicrafts. Bamboo enhances the micro-organisms habitat living in Rhizosphere (high biological activity and high nutrient availability) of the roots system and maintains the soil moisture throughout the year. The decaying bamboo leaves become a natural compost. The land owners are therefore very content and are willing to recommend the technology to their neighbors who also own land along the stream banks. The weaknesses: (1) Once the bamboo expands and grows into clumps it becomes the habitat of mosquitoes and snakes and thus weeding is required. (2) Bamboo leaves that have fallen into the water decay afterwards and deteriorate the water quality, and therefore it is recommended to cut back old branches before the leaves have the opportunity to fall into the stream.COMMENTS:There are many bamboo trees in the forest along the stream but the land user who implements this technology is only in a single site in the village.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Native species utilization","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1201","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|disaster management|income increase","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 922, 918, 917, 897, 898, 910, 914, 1154, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

The technology improves productivity and generates income for the farmers. The implementation requires drip irrigation system.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Melisa LjusaThe cultivation of blueberries in plant pots has been successfully implemented in the area of \u017divinice municipality - on soils of poor composition, physical properties and low fertility. Many efforts have been made to introduce a conventional production of blueberries but did not bring the expected results due to the bad soil quality.\nThe soil (Stagnogley) is poorly permeable to water, so even moderate rainfalls cause water remain on the surface, making it difficult or completely impossible to cultivate the land. In addition, soils of high acidity are required for the successful cultivation of blueberries. Planting blueberries in a conventional way is often carried out on soils where the acidity is increased by various additives (often with wood sawdust or similar wooden materials). Practical experience has showed that in the course of time the acidic properties of the soil in the zone of the development of the blueberry root change, i.e. soil\/substrate acidity decreases due to resorption processes on the primary soil. Todays\u0027 market offers multi-component substrates for the cultivation of blueberries, which, in addition to their adequate acidity, have other properties necessary for a good development of the blueberry\u0027s root system. These substrates were also used in some localities of the municipality of \u017divinice in conventional or modified conventional planting of blueberries (on embankments using soil and commercial substrates). This technique did not yield satisfactory results, probably because of the loss of substrate properties (decrease of soil acidity) due to resorption to the nearby original soil. The substrate keeps its desirable properties much longer if it is put into the planting where blueberries are being planted.\nThe basic advantage  of this technology is its ability to be applied on practically all soils of poor agricultural-productive properties, including heavily degraded and low water permeable soils. Even if the cost for introducing the technology is relatively high, its maintenance is reduced to standard agro-technology  (fertigation, plant protection, weed control, harvesting, etc.) due to the type of crop. In the \u017divinica municipality, technology is currently being applied only in the cultivation of blueberries. The results have shown that the cultivation of blueberries in plant pots provides a yield of about 15 t\/ha, which is about 5 t\/ha (50%) higher than in the conventional cultivation of the blueberries. The farm on which the technology is described cultivated blueberries of the Duke variety on 8 ha whose fruits are sold at prices between 3.50 and 4.50 USD\/kg. The estimated life span of the blueberries grown in plant pots under full yield is 15 years.\nRegarding the technical characteristics of the SLM technology, the plant pots with blueberry plantings are placed in rows of low trenches with a distance of 100-120 cm between the plant pots  (from center to center); and 250-300 cm between rows. The plant pots (60 to 90 liters) are placed in later formed embankments (trussing with the original soil), thus ensuring the stability of the plant pots (e.g. from wind) and more favorable temperature and humidity conditions of the substrate in the plant pots. The technology implies possession and use of the drip irrigation system, using the water collected in accumulations and distributed from tanks situated on the farm.\nThe technology offers relatively innovative use of infertile or degraded soils for the intensive and profitable production of blueberries or other crops, primarily berry fruits. Positive experiences from the implementation of the technology on about 8 ha, on the observed farm resulted in the replacement of the earlier conventionally planted and grown blueberries in the wider area of \u017divinice. By expanding blueberries cultivation in wider areas, the municipality is considered among the leading blueberry producers in the Balkans.COMMENTS:The land, where the described technology is applied, is characterized by bad soil physical properties (heavy soils, poorly permeable to water, even moderate rainfalls do not allow movement of workers and mechanization).SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Digital technologies|Sensor","type_id":"993, 1188, 1015, 1036","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|optimization of resource use for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|income increase|Alternative food production|production of food in limited spaces (e.g. vertical farming)","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 910, 914, 915, 909, 916, 921, 1180, 934, 935","readiness_level":"7.

Livestock convert fodder shrubs and grasses from the forest, crop residues, and other fodder into manure through digestion. However, in the middle hills of Nepal the lack of availability of good quality fodder often limits not only, the productivity of livestock, but also reduces the nitrogen content of animal dung if, for example, only cereal crop residues, are fed to the animals.\nIn earlier times, livestock were left to graze in the forests and on community lands. The animals sought out their own food and were only assembled for milking and to protect them from wild animals. With the introduction of stall-feeding, the demand for fodder has increased greatly with a subsequent large increase in women\u2019s workload as it is they who are responsible for collecting the fodder.\nMost fodder is collected in forest areas, and most livestock manure is applied to arable land, in particular to rainfed fields. This results in a net transfer of nutrients from forest areas to arable lands. It is estimated that, in this way, about 3 to 7 ha of forest land is needed to maintain 1 ha of arable land without degrading the state of the forest. In addition to reducing the availability of forest resources, the widespread closure of community forests has diminished access to fodder during certain times of the year. All this is putting serious pressure on the remaining unprotected forest resources.\nMarginal lands and terrace risers offer an opportunity to reduce this pressure. The planting of grasses and shrubs suitable for fodder on these areas not only increases fodder availability but also reduces erosion and landslides that originate in these areas. If leguminous fodder species are planted, they increase soil fertility by increasing the nitrogen content in soils.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Increasing livestock numbers causing the degradation of unprotected forest areas. The closure of large areas of community managed forests to grazing and fodder collection is putting more pressure on unprotected forest areas and increasing the demand for alternative sources of fodder and better quality fodder.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Native species utilization|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1201, 1200, 1206","use_cases":"Production|animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 916, 927, 921, 922, 917, 918, 910, 914, 909","readiness_level":"7.

Ferula assa-foetida, or hing, is a medicinal plant that grows well in shallow sandy and alkaline soils in semi-arid climates and at high altitudes and is a native plant of Afghanistan\u2019s upper catchment areas. Due to the enduring conflict and the consequent breakdown of community-managed grazing in upper catchment areas, most range-lands in Afghanistan are been seriously degraded. Uncontrolled grazing of animals and growing cereal crops on range-lands are the main contributors to the loss of vegetation coverage in upper catchments. One of the negative consequences are flash floods occurring several times a year, damaging agricultural lands, irrigation canals, houses and other infrastructure while often also causing fatalities.\nIn order to decrease the risk of flash floods, improve pastures and extend cash crop cultivation in upper catchment areas, HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation has implemented community-based watershed activities such as structural and agronomic measures to control water runoff.\nHing has been identified as a suitable agronomic measure in watershed management in Saighan district. HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation and the target communities selected hing as a valuable cash crop and a suitable plant for watershed rehabilitation. Today, hing is cultivated on 1,400,000 m2 (140 ha) in nine watersheds and with the participation of 1500 families. The growing period of hing depends on the local climate but tends to be 5-10 years and culminates in the pants\u2019 flowering. During the first five years hing has grey colored leaves. Later a stem appears and grows more than a meter high. The stem is large and yellow and at the end of the main and subordinate stems are yellow flowers. The width of the hing root varies between 7-15 cm and usually goes as deep as 30-40 cm into the soil. Hing plantations have been established with the involvement of the local communities and are managed by the responsible watershed committee. The harvest of hing is organized by the watershed committee and all households have the right to participate and sell hing for income generation. To maintain watershed activities, such as hing cultivation, a safe box has been created for each community-managed watershed. The watershed committee manages the safe box and collects funds for maintenance, community development and emergency projects, according to the watershed management plan which has been developed by the local communities with support of HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation.\nNatural \/ human environment: Bamyan is a remote province of Afghanistan with a high poverty rate. It has a semi-arid climate with cold winters and hot and dry summers. During winter, temperatures can drop below -22 degrees. Summer temperatures can reach to 34 degrees in the month of July. The average annual rainfall in the area is about 230 mm and some years can be very dry. 90% of the population relies on subsistence agriculture for their livelihoods and off-farm activities are marginal. The growing season in Saighan district is relatively short from April to October and farmers can produce only one crop per year. Farmers with access to irrigation water cultivate cash crops, for example potato and vegetables, in addition to staple (wheat) and fodder crops. Those without access to irrigation water cultivate wheat and fodder crops only. Water scarcity from May to September may result in a lack of high value crops.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Lack of management in upper catchment area over the last decades resulted in a severe loss of vegetation and in the loss of biodiversity. Uncontrolled grazing of animals during the spring season prevented seed production of domestic plants. Hot temperature in summer burnt the remaining parts of domestic plants. Each year, the soil is washed away by heavy rainfalls creating gulleys which further reduced the vegetation cover.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): The users of watershed areas cut shrubs for fuel and graze their animals.

The technology describes the propagation of these important trees from locally collected seeds and their cultivation.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Stefan MichelThe technology is used to produce seedlings of juniper trees in the forestry nursery for further replanting in the natural juniper woodlands of the local forestry enterprise. Juniper woodlands are important ecosystems of the mountains of Central Asia, which are typically used for livestock grazing. The tree cover fulfills important functions for the maintenance of ecosystem services \u2013 local microclimate, regulation of water infiltration and surface runoff, biodiversity, esthetic value and recreation, fuelwood etc. The local juniper species rarely rejuvenate naturally. Factors hampering natural rejuvenation include intensive grazing, competition by other plant species and weather conditions. Loss of old juniper trees due to natural losses, damage and cutting combined with lacking rejuvenation causes the degradation and loss of juniper stands. Forestry enterprises in Central Asia often in such situations instead of the difficult to cultivate and slowly growing native juniper often plant non-native arborvitae Thuja spec. These non-native species do not provide the natural ecosystem functions of native juniper and are less adapted to the local site conditions.\nThe purpose of the described technology is therefore the provision of planting material for the rehabilitation of degraded juniper woodland pastures with native trees. \nForestry workers collect ripe juniper fruits from their natural stands during late fall (November \u2013 December). The fruits are than mixed with sand and stored in a cold place until spring, or they are further processed to accelerate germination. \nIn the first case in spring the fruits are crushed on a clean concrete surface either by trampling with boots or by using a vehicle. Afterwards the crushed fruits are washed and air-dried. With the help of wind and a sieve the dried seeds are cleaned from other parts of the fruits. The seeds are then stored under a 5 cm layer of sand until fall and sown in fall (October-November)\nIn the second case the fruits are initially for one month stored in a barrel with water. Then the fruits are crushed and cleaned as described above. The cleaned seeding material will be stored in a pit, covered with moist sand mixed with some dung from horses or cattle. After one month the seeds are sown into the nursery.\nIn the area of the forestry enterprise brown bears feed on juniper fruits. In the bear feces many juniper seeds can be found, sometimes directly germinating. This \u201cnatural stratification\u201d is sometimes used by forestry workers if they find substantial amounts of bear feces consisting of juniper fruits.\nThe seeds are sown directly into the soil in the nursery. Each, germination rate and survival are 90%. After five years the seedlings have grown to a height of about 20-30 cm, their roots reach 20 cm deep into the soil and they are ready for replanting. \nThe seedlings are carefully dug out, deep enough not to damage the root system and together with the earth covering the roots. They are wrapped in plastic bags for keeping the earth cover of the roots during transportation. During the planting the seedlings are put into the tree pits together with the soil from the nursery still covering the root system. The planted seedlings are watered.\nAfter planting the seedlings are five years cared for, including weeding and if necessary watering either from a canal, if available, or with barrels. \nThe use of containers for seeding and replanting has not yet been tried. It may protect the root system during replanting and reduce the amount of soil to be used for this purpose. On the other hand the technology without containers is not dependent on their availability, no garbage in form of plastic containers is left in the tree pits and the larger amount of soil from the nursery may ease establishment of the seedlings at the woodland rehabilitation site.COMMENTS:The approximate locatoion of the nursery is indicated. The planting of produced seedlings takes place in different areas.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Native species utilization|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1198, 1201, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|Farm management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production","use_cases_id":"916, 927, 917, 918, 920, 921, 910, 915, 897, 1186, 899","readiness_level":"7.

This practice is mainly suitable for the maintenance and improvement of the soil\u2019s fertility.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Sok PheakCultivation of mixed organic vegetables or agriculture based on natural principles is a system which utilizes raw materials, including green plants, animal manure, farm wastes as well as medical plants. All of these materials can be found locally. It avoids the use of any chemical substances or insecticides for the elimination of insects. The implementation of this technology ensures the health of humans, animals, and organisms living in the soil, thereby also securing the soil\u2019s fertility. Moreover, it helps to improve the household economy by reducing the costs of buying chemical fertilizers and other materials (MAFF, 2012, MoEYS \u0026amp; VVOB Cambodia, 2013, Social Compass, 2017). \nMs. Teav Chat is one of the farmers growing organic vegetables who was selected to be interviewed for this case study. She has won the national award of best farmer in the production of organic vegetables. She lives in Thma Reab village, Pongro commune, Rolea B\u0027ier district, Kompong Chhnang province, Cambodia. The production of mixed organic vegetables has been implemented since 2004, under the initiative of the Cambodia Center for Study and Development in Agriculture (CEDAC). Around her house she currently grows vegetables on 0.70 ha of land. During the study, she was cultivating mixed organic vegetables including lettuce, cucumbers, yard-long beans, Chinese mustard, pok choi, choy sum, morning glory, spring onions, luffa gourds, wax gourds, holy basil, sweet basil, lemon grassand okra. The most important vegetables out of this group are lettuce, cucumbers, yard-long beans, cabbage vegetables, morning glory and spring onions. \nThe fundamental components of this technology are the production, and utilization of natural fertilizers (cow manure, dry compost and liquid compost), the combination of medical plants containing natural poisons to combat pests, a natural irrigation source (such as digging a well or a pond), multi cropping, intercropping, as well as crop rotation. As she raises cows, only cow manure is used as fertilizer. Dry compost is made from fresh manure, the leaves of woody herbs or other green leafed plants, rice straw and biochar. Then, the liquid compost is mixed with cow manure, woody herbs, fish heads, boraphed, and cow\u2019s urine. Remarkably, the farmer places these ingredients mixed together with cow\u2019s urine that is collected daily without addition of water. Regarding the production of insecticide, she created a mixture of chili, galangal, together with the leaves or shells of the downy thorn apple. \nThe main purpose of this technology is to obtain mixed organic vegetables and generate a more regular household income by also reducing the expenses involved in buying chemical fertilizers and pesticides. In other words, organic vegetables have a solid domestic market, consisting of home-based buyers, and so the farmer spends less time for selling her production. The crop diversification respectively mixed organic vegetables supports the farmer also in reducing the exposure to market fluctuations. This means that she should have a wide range of organic vegetables in order to supply the market during all seasons, thereby being able to generate an income throughout the year. In this way the farmer earns a net income 3,330,000 Riel per year. Beside this, the cultivation of organic vegetables using natural fertilizers improves the soil\u2019s fertility. In this way the soil gets rich in microorganisms such as earth worms and other micro-organisms (bacteria or fungi) which play a vital role in decaying organic matter which transform into nutrients for the plants.\nIn this case study, the natural fertilizer cow manure was used whilst drying the soil in the field or when ploughing the soil in order to expose it. The dry compost is generally applied at the base of the crop roots when the vegetable are planted. Furthermore the liquid compost is used as a fertilizer once the crop begins to grow by irrigating it every three days in the evenings. About 100 ml of liquid compost is mixed with 10 liters of water in order to irrigate the rows with a width of 0.5 meters and a length of 10 meters. For regular maintenance, the fertilizer is added to each of the vegetable crops depending also on the quantity of natural fertilizer that is available. Natural pesticides are also used to ward off insects or to prevent them from destroying the crop.COMMENTS:This technology is implemented on the land area 0.70 hectare.The farmer cultivated main crops, such as lettuce, cabbage, morning glories and yard-long beans.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biologicals|Biotechnologies|Biofertilizers and biopesticides|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation|Low-cost farming tools and techniques","type_id":"993, 2100, 994, 1001, 1196, 1198, 1200, 1206, 1076, 1088, 1089","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|minimize pesticide use|Access to markets|direct sale to consumers or businesses|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|field management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 917, 921, 926, 928, 929, 915, 912, 914","readiness_level":"7.

Specific rice varieties, characterized by extended and rapidly growing roots, are particularly well-suited to this type of rice cultivation. These roots enable the plants to access deeper water resources, in the absence of rainfall throughout the crop cycle.\nRMME may be situated in lowlands or along the banks of floodable rivers, often on levelled plots enclosed by dikes. Water is sourced from springs, river intakes, or through brief flooding. However, careful management of the water level within the rice field is essential.\nTransplanting or dry-sowing methods can be employed under RMME. Dry sowing is preferred when the availability of water in the rice field is uncertain, an increasingly common scenario with climate change. The nursery can be placed near the rice field, on a plot with water resources, or in proximity to the village.\nThe rice varieties selected for RMME cultivation are characterized by long roots and rapid growth, with examples including Sebota 70, 281, and 410 (with a 105-day vegetative cycle). During transplanting, it is crucial to ensure that the age of the seedlings does not exceed 15 to 20 days. This precaution prevents the young rice plants from rooting deeply in the nursery, reducing the risk of root breakage during transplanting, which could otherwise hinder their tillering capacity. Transplanting is carried out in rows.\nFor fertile or well-fertilized soils, the recommended spacing is 20 cm * 20 cm. This configuration allows for the manual rotary hoe to pass in both directions during weeding. In less fertile soils, the spacing between rows remains 20 cm, but plants within the same row are spaced 10 cm apart. In this scenario, the rotary hoe only needs to pass through one row.\n.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Flood mitigation strategies|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1203, 1204, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|improved plant varieties|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 902, 912, 916, 918, 920, 921","readiness_level":"7.

Generally, this zone, located at 2000-3800 meters above sea level is used by farmers as summer pastures. Farmers are practicing agro-pastoralism by grazing animals and at the same time producing winter fodder for their livestock. They cultivate mainly barley and sometimes perennial grass.\nThe territory of the local administration of the Aiyl Okrug \u201cSuusamyr\u201d includes 6645 hectares of arable land. In 2009 about 2500 hectares were  cultivated with cereals (including 1950 ha of barley) and 250 ha with sainfoin. As a result of the monoculture of cereals, weeds, pests, and insects accumulate on the fields and the soil fertility is declining. These are direct and indirect indicators of soil degradation.\nThe main cultivated perennial legume  is sainfoin. However,farmers are short of sainfoin seeds. Most of them cultivate sainfoin for hay making and consider the seed production as non profitable. \nFallow is maintained free from weed during the vegetation season. As fallow is weed free and accumulates the soil moisture it has synergy effect to harvest high yield of barley grain. This fallow is kept during one vegetation season and applied by other farmers during next season. Crop rotation cycle is 5 years including 1 year-fallow period (1year-fallow period, 1year for barley planting and 3 years for sainfoin planting). Barley is planted into the fallow.\nSainfoin improves the soil structure as a result of high rizo-biomasses (237-333 kg\/ha). Sainfoin is able to accumulate 194 -178 kg\/ha of biological nitrogen providing sufficient nitrogen fertilization for two consecutive cropping seasons. Sainfoin can be cultivated at altitudes from 700 to 3400 m above sea level (G. Balian, 2004). Sainfoin is a high nectar producting crop, allowing farmers to produce 150 kg of honey from 1 hectare of sainfoin during a vegetation period. As the result of insect pollination,  an increase in seed production of between 100 and 200 kg\/ha has been observed.\nPurpose of the Technology: Soil fertility conservation through crop rotation of barley with the perennial grass sainfoin (Onobrichis sativa).\nFarmer Ibraimov Azimjan has 25 hectares of private land and rents other land from neighboring farmers.  UNDP\u2019s project procured seeds of sainfoin and covered expenditures for tillage and planting. The farmer\u2019s responsibility is to distribute produced seeds among other farmers which are able to expand their areas under  sainfoin cultivation.  The farmers maintains crop rotation.\nFields are located in the foothills at an elevation of 2038-2200 m above sea level. Plowing is conducted along the slope. But planting is done across to the tilling direction, horizontally along the field (contour planting drilling). This technology increases vegetation cover and after harvesting stubbles remain\nAgriculture in Suusamyr Valley is based on animal husbandry which is kept on pastures during three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). But farmers practice agro-pastorals. They have private arable land and produce cereals and forage crops.  The Local Government \u201cSuusamyr\u201d has 6645 hectares of arable land including 561 hectares  from the  Distribution Found (state regulated land).

Project manager also had finance support in field inspection of sainfoin seed and barley.\nFarmer\u2019s responsibility is to distribute  seed among other farmers which able to expand their areas under sainfoin.  Farmer has resources to guard the field from grazing of animals during the vegetation period, harvest and transportation of seed. Azimjan also organized the seed cleaning and storage. Project\u2019s management developed the rules on seed distributions and sale.\nThe farmer should produce sainfoin and barley in order to get benefit. Farmer\u2019s responsibility is to distribute seed to other farmers which able to expand the area under  sainfoin and barley. Name of sainfoin variety is \u201cBelek\u201d, barley variety is \u201cKylym\u201d, they are developed in research centers of Kyrgyz Republic.  \nThe population of the Aiyl Okrug \u201cSuusamyr\u201d is 6400. The Local Government has no human resources for field activities.  There are six villages at the territory of this Local Government. All fields and villages are connected by dirt roads. The electricity is supplied on regularly basis.  People have drinking water supplies.\nFarmer\u2019s fields are located at foothills of 2038-2200 m above sea level. The type of land use is rainfed. Some irrigated channels which were developed in Soviet time are destroyed now. The fields are infested mainly with wild Oat, Couch-grass, spp. pigweed, wormwood and others.\nThe farmers cultivate cereals as monoculture. Some of them plant the sainfoin. Additionally, farmers cultivate potato on a total area of 180-200 hectares. The varieties are from local breeders (Nevsky, Cardinal) and introduced varieties from seed Firm \u201cAgrico\u201d and \u201cNZPC\u201d (Picasso, Sante and Mondial).\n The main type of soil is chestnut (light chestnut soil and dark chestnut  soil). The potential fertility of these soils is high but due to the lack of crop rotation, plant protection activities, fertilizer application, soil degradation is going on.  There are no soil maps in the office of local administration except for those which were developed during the Soviet time.COMMENTS:Boundary points of the Technology area: The sainfoin is cultivated on mountain pastures from 800 meters to 3000 meters above sea levelMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Decline of soil fertility due to longstanding cultivation of barley on the field. Annual conventional plowing is affecting the mineralization of soil humus.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Decline of barley yield.

He planted mulberry trees the same year. At that time, orchards were established in the whole surrounding area because the government decreed that a territory should have plenty of mulberry trees. Despite the government plan, all the land users of that area began to switch their orchards into wheat crops. Five years later the farmer planted apple trees within the mulberry orchard. The orchard had 200 mulberry and 100 apple trees. The motivation was to feed the working farmers of the fields around. Five years later the apple trees gave fruits. But only the first two years gave a good yield and income from selling them. Later on the fruits were just eaten by the farmer\u2019s family. After another seven or eight years the farmer grew a wheat crop in between the tree lines. Nowadays it\u0027s the only remaining orchard in that area. Due to the lack of proper maintenance and water availability the orchard is degraded and the output is very low.\nPurpose of the Technology: The government established a large territory of mulberry orchards, for three reasons: First to reduce the impact of natural hazards, second to increase silk production and last to improve fire wood availability. The planting of apple trees should be beneficial for farmers working in the surrounding crops and well as for the family, who sell the fruits and the mulberry leaves. As the yield started to decrease the wheat crop was established to have a bigger output for that crop.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Due to the government\u2019s order to establish orchards, the local authorities provided the mulberry trees. Hence, it was in the responsibility of the farmer to plant the trees and to look after them by soil loosening and pruning. The latter activity must be done once in the first five years after planting. The farmer bought the apple trees himself as they were cheap at that time. To establish the wheat crop, ploughing, seeding, fertilizing and finally harvesting must be done. One person is supposed to guard the orchard and wheat crop every day. Yearly maintenance consists of soil loosening around the fruit trees and the above mentioned task for cropping. The maintenance of the orchard seems to be abandoned more and more, probably because the output decreases year by year.\nNatural \/ human environment: The orchard is situated below Momandion village, on the very last foot slope before the valley plain begins and, hence, it has a slight slope,. In the past, orchards were numerous, but nowadays wheat crops have mostly replaced the orchard. As there is no fence and no one to control it regularly, livestock invades the property. During its first two years there was a water source, which had dried up by the time. The orchard is a relic being the only and last one in that area. Broken branches, unpruned trees and a trampled crop, show signs of insufficient control and maintenance and therefore of a gradual abandonment of the orchard.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.01 km2.\nAccording to farmer it\u0027s 1 ha, according to GoogleEarth around 1.6 haMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Trampled and degraded soil as a consequence of no fences or control.

Wheat is growing in the slightly pronounced terraces and recently some vines were planted this year. The rain fed orchard lies in the low part of the middle zone and has a slight slope. The absence of control and fence results in broken branches and trampled parts in the plot. The farmer is sharing the property with his four brothers, who inherited the property from their father in 1993 or 1994. The orchard was established during Soviet time in 1988. The government paid for the material and the farmer\u2019s family did the labour. The government paid them for that input by crop yield. In addition to the orchard the farmer sewed wheat between the rows several years ago which adds up to a hectare of wheat crop in total. In the current year (2012), the workload and the yield have been very small. As there was heavy rainfall in spring, the farmer did not see the need to loose soil around the trees. The already old fruit trees gave low yield and, because of a hale storm, apples were destroyed.\nPurpose of the Technology: Initially the government planned to manage land and make it more profitable by establishing orchards. Due to that intention the farmer\u2019s family had work, subsistent crop and cash crops. Today the main source of income is the remittances from the sons who work in Russia. The farmer works part time as a taxi driver. The orchard lost its importance of main income.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: At the time of the establishment of the fruit trees, the Soviet government paid for the seedlings and tractor fuel. Labour was done by the farmer, his brothers and their parents. The whole family worked for two years to build the orchard because they only had the possibility to work in the evenings and on weekends. Nowadays it is still a part time job for the farmer. Maintenance activities consist of ploughing, occasional soil loosening around the trees, pruning and harvesting apples and wheat. The wheat is cut by hand, which is very hard work. Because of heavy rainfalls last spring no soil was loosened. There is nobody to protect the orchard from grazing livestock.\nNatural \/ human environment: The orchard lies on a foothill in the middle zone, close to the settlements of the valley. The apples trees are growing in rows on small terraces built by ploughing for years. Down- and upwards there are also orchards growing, all delimited laterally by the riverbed and a road. On one side of the plot a gully is developing rapidly. All of the neighbouring orchards seem to have a lack of maintenance and control.

Since 1999 the farmer has cultivated wheat and feed grain, rotating year by year. According to the farmer, wheat and feed grain cropping does not provide a benefit on that plot, when money and labour inputs are considered. But as straw is scarce but is needed for his cows, the farmer gets that by-product from harvesting wheat. Furthermore, as that plot is accessible by the tractor for ploughing, he plants wheat and will continue doing that in future, even though the output is low. Though the farmer has a land user\u0027s certificate for that property, it becomes common for livestock grazing after the harvest. This causes overgrazing, bare soil, trampling and other issues.\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of cropping wheat is to get straw for feeding. According to the farmer the bad quality of soil and the absence of water do not allow a different crop type than wheat.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Establishment and maintenance activities are almost the same. The crop must be ploughed, seeds planted and fertilizer applied. Though no fertilizer was needed at the beginning of crop cultivation, now its use is increasing. Between the time of planting and harvesting, the crop is regularly safe guarded from grazing livestock. If herds approach, the farmer or a family member will protect the crop. After the harvest, the crop is somehow declared as communal land, where cattle are allowed to graze there.\nNatural \/ human environment: The crop is situated on a ridge above the village of Chargii bolo. It is a small sized terrace with a slight slope. Soil quality and moisture were already very poor when the crop was established, which results in a low output comparing to the input. The soil is compacted and shows a low level of organic matter, soil moisture and nutrients. The farmer complains about the small sharp stones of around 1-2 cm of diameter in the soil. They indicate a high level of soil degradation. Although the slope is slight, the vertical ploughing has caused small rills in the lower part of the plot and some more pronounced rills off-site. The plot is the property of the farmer, but is used as pasture after harvest for the livestock. Soil compaction, lowered vegetation cover and water infiltration result from trampling and overgrazing. There\u2019s no agreement between cultivars and herders, reason why this crop continues to be grazed uncontrolled.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Low soil nutrients and moisture on that plot. Bare and crusted soil which cause worse infiltration capacities and soil erosion. Building of small rills enhanced through vertical ploughing.\nAdditionally, overgrazing by livestock, compaction of soil.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Crop was already degraded at the beginning but its getting worse.

He owns the crop since seven years and switches between chickpea and wheat every year. When he started to cultivate, soil properties were good, he did not use fertilizer. Because of the years of ploughing, the soil lost nutrients and moisture. The more rill building and slope instability is severe currently. The plot is over one hectare because it includes a narrow vegetation strip between his and the neighbours crop. The plot, as all the other crops are grazed by livestock, after harvest.\nPurpose of the Technology: Chickpea cropping generates a satisfactory yield, whereas wheat production is rather variable and low. Nevertheless the farmer would not change the crop type because the main purpose is to get straw for feeding his cows. The farmer has over three hectares in total. Even though he claims the benefit to be low comparing to the input, he is content as long he can feed his family.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Ploughing, sowing and then harvesting were part of the establishment phase. The same activities count for maintenance. But as soil is gradually washed away, fertilizing became crucial. The farmer does not control and protect the crop from wild animals and grazing herds.\nNatural \/ human environment: The crop lies on a foot slope not far from the riverbed. Neighbouring cultivations are of the same crop type, chickpea, wheat and food grain. It is less than one kilometre away from the farmers home in Doshmand village.

The plant can be used as medicine or fodder  (vetiver) or food (izote flower).\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Helen GambonThe Department of Olancho is a rainforest located in Cordillera Central and Sierra de Agalta, at an average altitude of 1500 masl. In spite of having large protected areas, the agricultural frontier (agriculture and livestock) is being expanded mainly by large landowners and, to a lesser degree, by peasants. This change in land-use also involves burning, a practice that furthers soil degradation. The Department of Olancho is frequently affected by tropical storms and hurricanes from the Atlantic. This combination of frequent and intense natural phenomena, the level of susceptibility and inadequate use of natural resources, generally causes significant damage and even the loss of human lives.\nTerraced curved live hedges are grown on unstable slopes and those tending towards erosion and instability. Vetiver has proven effective in stabilizing slopes. It is a perennial grass that is highly adaptable to a broad variety of conditions. Though it can grow in degraded soils, and in dry or humid conditions, it requires sun and does not do well in the shade. Vetiver roots can grow over 3 meters and intertwine tightly.\nVetiver is palanted in densly clustered rows on terraced curves. Thus, it protects the slope by reducing the speed of surface rainwater run-off; it also enables water to filter into the ground and reduces soil erosion; further, it acts as a filter and retains sediment. Good management of live hedges results in the gradual formation of terraces. Terraced curved live hedges are frequently combined with other bioengineering technologies, such as draining trenches or terracing. For more information on implementing live hedges with vetiver grass, see the technical drawing. If the hedges are planted during the summer, these need to be watered every three days; the plant grows on their own during the winter. The space between the grass rows can be used to grow vegetables, since nutrients accumulate here. The hedges must be trimmed to 50 cm every two months to strengthen them. All empty spaces along the hedges have to be filled. Also, it is important to weed the hedges. Sprouts can be used to plant new hedges.\nIzote (Yucca Gigantea flowers) or pineapple (Ananas comosus) may be used instead of vetiver. Izote can be planted in dense rows or at a distance of up to 30 cm. Additional measures can be used to enhance effectiveness according to the slope, such as planting bushes behind the izote plants. Pineapples are planted at a distance of 30-50 centimeters. Though it does not have deep roots, it does grow densely. Pineapples are frequently planted in hedges growing close to homes or schools, because vetiver grass tends to attract rodents and snakes.\nIn this case study, live hedges of vetiver grass on terraced curves have been implemented through the Honduran\/Swiss Red Cross Project \u201cResiliencia\u201d. This project aims at providing sustainable support to enhance resilience in all rural regions in Olancho, and to help reduce risks of disasters and to promote health at all levels (home, community, municipality). Bioengineering works are implemented in critical areas according to risk assessments.COMMENTS:Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides) or izote (Yucca sp.)SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1198","use_cases":"Farm management|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|field management","use_cases_id":"910, 1154, 916, 918, 921, 917, 920, 922, 914","readiness_level":"7.

It is particularly suitable for dry regions prone to Prosopis invasions, especially those experiencing drought periods of more than four months, which allow the herbicide to take significant effect. To avoid chemical contamination, the technology should only be applied in areas located more than 200 meters away from water sources.\nThis method requires simple tools to cut trees efficiently, with a chainsaw being recommended for the task. However, in areas where infestations cover less than 20 percent of the land, simpler tools such as machetes can be used. Trees should be cut as close to the ground as possible (no more than 15 cm stump height), and herbicide should be applied to the stump within three minutes of cutting. The treatment should be carried out during the dry season, ensuring no rainfall is expected within a month to allow for complete absorption of the herbicide.\nA minimum of two people equipped with proper protective clothing is required for this operation: one to cut the trees and another to apply the herbicide and clear the cut branches. The herbicide, typically Triclopyr, is often mixed with diesel at a 1:50 ratio. A follow-up application is crucial to target any trees that were not completely killed during the initial treatment.\nHerbicides can be ordered from Arysta Co. Ltd in Tanzania at a cost of TZS 1,000,000 (USD 430) per 20 liters. The advantages of using this technology include its effectiveness in killing the trees and the ability to utilize the cut branches as fuelwood or for making Prosopis charcoal. However, the major drawbacks include limited information leading to scepticism among land users regarding the health risks and potential long-term effects on soil quality, as well as the limited availability of the herbicide in local agro-stores.COMMENTS:Crop cultivation and grazing are rotated to avoid crop damage and sometimes cropland is fenced with thorny branches of Prosopis juliflora to deter livestock from accessing the crop fields.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Chemicals|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 2073, 1188","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|animal production","use_cases_id":"916, 927, 917, 910, 914, 897, 898, 899","readiness_level":"7.

It involves the cutting of the target tree not more than 15 cm from the ground followed by spraying or painting the freshly cut stump surface, the stump and root collar with the herbicide. Tordon (Picloram 65g\/l + 2,4-D 240g\/l) is usually mixed with an oil-based substance such as diesel and applied immediately and not more than 15 minutes after cutting for best results to be achieved. Oil-based solvents act as penetrants increasing the rate of chemical absorption by the plants. For mature trees with wide diameters, the cambium at the edge of the cut stump is usually targeted in addition to the cut surface to kill the roots and stems hence prevent regrowth. The area should be fully wet with herbicide, but not so much that it induces runoff. This approach should be avoided in times of heavy rain which could prevent the herbicide from reaching the ground line. It is suitable where the density of the target invasive plant is low.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Chemicals","type_id":"993, 2073","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|minimize pesticide use|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"916, 927, 926, 917","readiness_level":"9.

The plant is thus usually mowed down to clear pastures and make way for more palatable species which would otherwise be suffocated by the presence of ferns.

Cyclopean concrete is stronger than rubble stone masonry. The width of the crest is 0.75 metres. The length generally ranges from 150 to 250 metres depending on the site. The height varies between two and four metres. Micro-dams are equipped with buttresses and a stilling basin. The dam can be built in the form of a dam bridge. Each dam is has a stoplog sluice for draining away sediment during the first rains of the season and to regulate water levels. The use of stoplog gates is recommended instead of sluice gates, as the latter are more technically sophisticated and require more maintenance. The dam creates a water reservoir upstream covering an area of between 4 and 15 hectares.\nFarming is carried out upstream and downstream in the rainy season and off-season.\nThe dam increases the amount of available surface water during the rainy season and groundwater during the off-season. Its effect on the water table depends on the depth of the scheme\u2019s foundations: the deeper the foundations, the greater the recharge of ground water.\nDuring the rainy season, the areas are used for rice growing. The wells used for irrigating market gardens are fed from the water table, meaning vegetables can be grown off-season. The water is also used for watering livestock, fish farming and, sometimes, domestic purposes. The dam increases the farmland areas, production and yields. Higher farming revenues lead to improved living conditions.\nInitially, an information and awareness-raising workshop on the IPRO-DB approach is organised at the commune level, involving the villages affected by the project. Following this, a general meeting is held to secure the support of the whole village for the development request. The village chief and commune mayor then sign off the request. The project team carries out a scoping study and socio-economic surveys. If the outcomes of the scoping studies and socio-economic surveys are positive, the project team draws up the terms of reference for working with the consultancies. This stage is followed by the selection of consultancies through tender processes to carry out the technical studies and produce the invitation to tender document, all of which will be overseen by the project team. The village then makes its financial contribution towards the project, the management committee is set up, and organisational and technical training is provided to beneficiaries. The final stages comprise the partial acceptance of the building works (for example, foundations, wall, buttresses, stilling basin, gabion reinforcements, etc.), the monitoring of scheme building works by the project team, payment for activities on a unit-price basis, and interim acceptance leading to final acceptance after one year. A management committee takes charge of opening and closing the stoplog gates, organises the maintenance of the scheme and institutes additional measures to protect the scheme (gabions, stone bunds, etc.). It collects and manages maintenance fees, ensures the committee\u2019s rules of procedure are adhered to and organises meetings of local producers. With minimum levels of maintenance, a scheme will remain functional for at least 20 years. Sustainable farming and management depend directly on employing a participatory approach.\nRoles of the actors involved: Beneficiaries provide labour and financial resources, and conduct monitoring and the small-scale maintenance of the scheme. The project team provides funding, training and beneficiary support, carries out studies and capitalises on project data. The commune signs off the village request and repairs major damage (an activity that has so far been undertaken by the project team). Consultancies and contractors conduct surveys, carry out building work and are responsible for oversight. Rural engineers: quarterly inspections are carried out by the Regional Directorate of Rural Engineering and the Regional Directorate of Agriculture.\nSince 2010, four dams were built so far in the Kolokani Circle (Tiembougou, Bamabougou, Korokabougou, Tienko).

Eventhough, many trees have been grazed and do not stand anymore. Besides steep areas there are small, quite flat areas (where the herder installs his tents), that used to be cultivated (wheat) till 1966. These areas generally have low cover-values and signs of rill-erosion, which the herder attributes to the past tilling activity. However, it might also be the trampling and sitting of the animals (staying near the herder\u0027s tent at noon-time and during the night) causing this erosion.

Grazing begins when soil moisture begins to decreaset, first with the little animals, that are supposed to better cope with slippery conditions. After two weeks the cows are led to the pastures and in some cases they will be grazed alone, because sheep and goats disturb them. The grazing zone is situated between 1400 and 1700 m.

The herders are advised to change place after 2-3 days, but often stay in one place for a longer time. The animals are gathered on the way out of the village a little after dawn, than brought to the pastures. At noon-time they will be lead to a shady place close to a stream, if possible.

These fodder pastures are grown on a 10 acre piece of land and harvested twice a week for chopping into chaff. For calliandra (a leguminous tree), leaves are harvested while elephant grass is cut at ground level. This vegetation is transported to the electric chaff cutter by tractor. At its best, the chaff is evenly cut, free of dust, of good colour and has a fresh aroma. The chaff is chopped into small pieces which allows for easy mixing with supplements. Chaff in Uganda can be produced on farm or purchased from commercial chaff cutting mills, which grow pastures and process them for sell to farmers during pasture scarcity in the long dry spells.\nThe farmer in Bushenyi District learnt the technology at a trade show. Today, he processes fodder for his 50 dairy cattle under an intensive system. His grazing\/paddock land is about 20 hectares in total and is divided into 8 paddocks which are used in rotation. The cows graze for 8 hours daily. Every evening their diet is supplemented with the processed fodder in the milking parlour. The fields are allowed to mature at intervals to produce a continuous supply of grass for fodder throughout the growing season. The fodder processing procedure includes:\ni) Cutting mature pasture grass at ground level and collecting the grass from the fields;\nii) Transportation of elephant grass and calliandrafrom the fields to the fodder shed;\niii) Offloading and sorting of pasture grass\/ fodder into different classes of similar diameter and lengths for easy handling during chaff cutting;\niv) Chopping of pastures\/ fodder into small pieces using the electric chaff cutter;\nv) Mixing the chaffed fodder, cotton seed cake, molasses and maize bran to improve the palatability and nutrient quality of the chaffed fodder.\nvi). Putting the processed fodder into troughs for cattle to feed on during milking.\nProcessing enough pasture grass into chaff for cattle feeding is described by the farmer to be a relatively expensive and a labour intensive process. The key expenses in establishing the system include costs of buying fodder (if not readily available on the farm), purchasing a chaff cutter and buying supplements. The farmer requires 0.5 tonnes of chaffed fodder mixed with supplements to feed 50 dairy cows on a daily basis. The main costs are labour, fodder supplements, the electric chaff cutter, tractor hire and daily operation costs.\nThe fodder cut into small pieces mixes easily with supplements to make a well nutrient balanced ration. This is palatable and encourages cattle to eat non-selectively and without spilling,hence minimizing wastage. The processed fodder is easy to store in bags and can be kept on wooden pallets raised off ground in a cool store. The farmer notes that the chaffed fodder can further be processed into hay or silage for storage to be fed to cattle during the seasons of pasture scarcity, especially the long dry spells of early June to late August and early December to late February. The system enables the farmer to keep more productive animals on his land than he could using other feeding regimes: in other words this is an intensive system that maximizes production per unit area.COMMENTS:The farmer has a 400 acres of land under cattle grazing, tea growing, pasture growing and fish farming.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Harvesting and processing equipment|Vehicles and machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1192, 1194","use_cases":"Production|animal production|livestock monitoring|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|improved animal breeds|animal health|Supply chain management|support to food processing","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 905, 910, 914, 909, 903, 907, 939, 943","readiness_level":"9.

Their above-ground dimensions are small, but trench depths can be quite substantial in the case of a subterranean dam two to three metres deep. Plastic sheeting is placed in the trench to stop the water flowing underground.\nWeirs are low-level structures built in flat valleys as extensions of small dams. Dam walls are low in height, standing from 0.1 m to 1 m above ground level.\nThe underground section of the dam retains upstream waters. As a result, the ground absorbs water and moisture throughout the entire area affected by the dam. The above-ground section (a watertight wall equipped with outflow gates) discharges the upstream water. It has a weir running along the marigot. Downstream, a stilling basin is installed to prevent erosion caused by the falling water. Using the weir and outflow gates, the water level can be adjusted to the requirements of each rice growing stage. The water retained by a dam equipped with a weir cannot be conserved for long periods. The structure\u2019s main role is to provide water to meet the needs of the rainy-season crops. Even though the trenches are deep and the plastic sheeting prevents underground water dissipation, weirs can help to ensure ground waters are well recharged. This is why farmers should wait before digging wells to extract water for vegetable growing.\nLocal people formulate the requirement and negotiate with the commune on the investment programme, identify the rules of access and set up the farming cooperatives and management bodies, provide materials and unskilled labour during construction, and undertake small-scale maintenance work. The commune plans investments and assumes overall control of the construction work, delegates management to users, validates the farming rules and oversees their correct application, and undertakes major repairs. Consultancies carry out the socio-economic, environmental and technical studies (scheme design, plans, models), draw up the invitation to tender document and support the tender selection process, and monitor and inspect works. Technical services oversee the application of technical and environmental standards, and participate in ensuring sound financial practices (collection, financial control, public service concessions). Contractors carry out the construction work. The project team provides training (planning, social engineering, studies involving farmers, etc.) and advisory support (organisation of users, formulation and validation of rules, area development plan, plan to develop and exploit value chains).\nThe scheme can remain functional for up to 20 years provided it is rigorously maintained.

It carefully balances how pastoralists use rangeland resources. The basis of the technology is three grazing rangeland governance zones: wet season grazing, dry season grazing, and drought reserves. There is also water governance based on a traditional hierarchy of rights. Through this system, Boran pastoralists adapt to severe and recurrent droughts.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  IBRAHIM JARSOThis grazing system is applied in Isiolo County, Northern Kenya. The Waso rangelands are inhabited by Boran pastoralists with Somali, Samburu, Rendille and Turkana herders sharing cross-border resources through negotiation. The technology is based on the maintenance of a delicate balance between livestock numbers, the supply of water, and the amount\/ quality of standing pasture within the vast grazing area which is water scarce and prone to extreme seasonal variations. Through its main tenet of governing grazing patterns (wet, dry season grazing area and drought reserve) planned use of pasture is decided in large pastoralists\u2019 assemblies attended by elders from a particular \u201cDedha\u201d (a grazing area, which administratively can be as big as two wards). This process is complicated by dry seasons and droughts of unknown length, with pressure from the community to open grazing reserves. Wrong decisions can spell the end of livelihoods for some families. An ability, which has been gradually eroded over time and by external factors which don\u2019t understand its enormous benefit but there is a project which is using an integrated approach to revive and empower this system.\nThe Jars  a Dedha use water points to manage grazing. Different types of water sources need specific forms of management. The most intensive management occurs during droughts at deep wells and boreholes which require the most labour to operate and maintain, and are the most reliable sources of water. Due to the strategic importance of these resources, management falls to the Jarsa Dedha (council of elders). The use of shallow wells is tightly controlled by both the aba ella (the person who first dug it) and aba erega (the owner of the rotter  ) working together. Aba ella is assigned first rights to water. If there is spare capacity then \u2018second rights\u2019 are decided by aba erega. Second rights would typically fall to those of a different clan, while \u2018third rights\u2019 might fall to a different ethnic group. The Borana customs and culture defines both access to certain wells but also the order of priority for watering animals.\nIn addition, in consultation with the Dedha council of elders, aba erega manages the use of dams and access to rivers. Generally, use of flowing river water is restricted to the dry season and access is limited to designated watering points. These are located some distance downriver from settlements to minimize disruption to inhabitants and to reduce contamination. Temporary water sources during and after the rains are not subject to control except when their use conflicts with restrictions on grazing areas. After watering their livestock, pastoralists traditionally fill their troughs for wildlife at night. This is intended to prevent wildlife from falling into wells - and to seek God\u2019s blessings.\nThe high variability of rainfall in pastoral areas leads to similarly variable pasture availability. Therefore, management of grazing resources needs to balance maximizing productivity while ensuring survival. Long-term viability of the system depends on the maintenance of adaptive traits within local breeds, and both maintaining and managing resources strategically. Only within these broader goals is the concept of \u2018maximizing productivity\u2019 meaningful.\nMature livestock (gues) which are not lactating are moved to remote pastures. The gues, which make up the majority of community livestock, are herded by young unmarried men. By utilizing remote pastures, grazing resources closer to permanent water sources can be preserved for the dry season and droughts. Pasture within the vicinity of homesteads (maar qaae  \u2013 literally \u2018near grass\u2019) is protected from grazing by non-lactating livestock (this is similar to kalo but a kalo reserve need not be next to the homestead ). This pasture is set aside for young animals  (calves, lambs, and kids). Migrating livestock have predefined routes that maintain distance from maar qaae. The Dedha council of elders, therefore, controls settlement patterns to preserve key migratory routes. Movement of livestock between different Dedhas must be prearranged with the respective Dedha council of elders who assess spare capacity in terms of water and grazing.\nThe floodplain grazing area (chaafa) is crucial because it acts as a refuge for livestock during extreme drought. Grazing in chaafa is strictly prohibited during the wet season and one of the critical decisions for the Jarsa Dedha is when to open chaafa after rains have failed. Due to the relatively moist conditions in chaafa, there are additional challenges to animal and human health: namely trypanosomiasis, ticks, pneumonia, and malaria. Jarsa Dedha make decisions primarily concerning seasonal movements from wet to dry season grazing and also the opening of boreholes and chaafa. The overwhelming local consensus is that efficient resource use depends on the ability ofJarsa Dedha  to enforce these regulationsCOMMENTS:Kinna Town, Kinna Ward, Garbatulla Sub County, Isiolo County\nIsiolo County has area of 25,000Km2 but 80% of the area is used for Nomadic pastoralism.Number of growing seasons per year: 2\nGrasses and shrubs which nourishes livestock grows during the rainy seasons\nLivestock density: Isiolo county is endowed with a substantial livestock resource base that includes 198,500 cattle, 399,000 goats, 361,900 sheep and 39,100 camelsSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Institutional|Governance function|Inclusive decision-making processes in agriculture|Partnerships|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement|Policy","type_id":"993, 1196, 1203, 1206, 1116, 1129, 1131, 1135, 1076, 1091, 1095","use_cases":"Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|optimization of resource use for better production|animal health|livestock monitoring|Farm management|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"897, 1186, 899, 909, 907, 905, 910, 1154, 916, 918, 920","readiness_level":"7.

As the water height of the annual flood wave of the Niger has decreased, some lakes and ponds receive little water. The disadvantages of this natural system are: the loss of harvests due to the flooding of fields before the crops have time to mature, and the rapid retreat of waters that inhibits the capillary effect across large areas.\nIn relation to the building of control structures and the deepening of channels supplying water to ponds and lakes, the projects main objectives are to: restore water supplies to the lakes and ponds previously fed by the Niger River; regularise water supplies to the ponds and lakes; increase the area under cultivation; restart the growing of flood recession crops and other activities in the areas around ponds and lakes; restore the environment and biodiversity around ponds and lakes; raise the water table around the ponds and lakes.\nThe deepening of the channels has made it possible to recharge lake and pond basins. It is the reason why we are now seeing the resumption of farming, market gardening, animal husbandry and fishing around the lakes and ponds. By building control structures and large dykes it is possible to control pond and lake recharge, optimise yields and crop growing, and increase the area under cultivation. There is a diversification of production and incomes through the farming of small family units and market gardening plots in the lake and pond areas. The installation of bridge crossings with causeways running across marshlands have helped to open up the area and, as such, facilitate the transport of farm produce, the provisioning of local communities and the circulation of road traffic. The development of the dual road\/ferry scheme (the Saraf\u00e9r\u00e9-Niafunk\u00e9 road and 40-tonne motor ferry) has revived an economic and human activity that was dying out due to extremely high levels of male outmigration, which left women running households and highly vulnerable.\nThe stages of initiating, planning and implementing works and installations are based on the studies (soil, topographical and socio-economic) carried out by a consultancy and private company recruited through a tender process to deliver the works according to a well-defined timetable. An oversight and control office undertakes the monitoring and control of works quality and the meeting of agreed deadlines.\nIn principle, works are carried out during low-water periods when most of the floodplains are dry. The swampy nature of the area makes any intervention in the rainy season impossible. Furthermore, the planning of activities must respect the constraints imposed by nature. The Dabi installation on Lake Takadji is a good example of the application of technical standards.\nThe application and modus operandi of this good practice involve the following: the water inlets for the lake and pond basins alongside the Niger River are reopened by deepening the feeder channels; the high waters of the Niger River feed the ponds and lakes; water supply is controlled using a cement structure fitted with gates to prevent: the water flow from reversing when the Niger\u2019s water levels are low, water flowing into the ponds and lakes before harvesting is complete; flood gauges to measure annual high water levels.\nVarious actors are involved in delivering this practice. Their roles are as follows: Beneficiaries are not required to participate in works delivered by contractors (works involving large pond and lakes), but they take charge of the development of VIS plots with support from the World Food Programme (WFP) in the form of supplies. External support from the project\/programme finances the installation of facilities, the pump units and the first season\u2019s inputs. Consultancies undertake feasibility studies, produce project specifications and plans, and carry out the monitoring and oversight of works. Local authorities, as a general rule, are involved in the planning of activities or, alternatively, make provision for activities in the PDESC. They also handle the upkeep and maintenance of installations.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 332 km2.\nIn terms of the ponds and lakes, the following objectives were achieved:\nSix large ponds were rehabilitated: Fati (13,000 hectares), Takadji (9,000 hectares) and Ganga (3,000 hectares), making a total of 25,000 hectares, Koboro (4,000 hectares), Kassoum-Soumpi (1,000 hectares), Billi I and Billi II (2,000 hectares), the Nounou-Diengo causeway on Lake Takadji (an additional 1,200 hectares), making a total of 8,200 hectares\nArea involved: 33,200 hectares\nNumber of beneficiaries: 190,000 producersMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): the loss of harvests due to the flooding of fields before the crops have time to mature, and the rapid retreat of waters that inhibits the capillary effect across large areas\nLivestock density: 1-10 LU \/km2SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Geospatial technologies|GIS|GPS|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies","type_id":"993, 1188, 1052, 1027, 1028, 1196, 1204","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|fisheries products management|Farm management|field management|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 900, 910, 914, 1180, 912, 916, 917, 920, 921, 918","readiness_level":"8.

Around 60 households let their livestock of totally 100 cows and some 400 sheep and goats graze there. The livestock is divided into three groups. Each group is meant to graze at different places in the pastureland. As there is no water point higher up in the pasture area, livestock graze near the village where a water point is installed. Due to this the riverbed, which is already poor in vegetation, is totally overgrazed. Every family is looking after a herd for a day every two month.\nPurpose of the Technology: The aim is to install more water points higher up in the pastureland to decrease pressure on soil and vegetation cover by improving rotation within the pastureland. The whole land is overgrazed and livestock numbers are increasing, which is why controlled pasture management could be expected to decrease the degradation process.  Nevertheless, more vegetation would be available for feeding livestock and the journey to the next water point shortened thus saving the heard\u2019s energy. As nobody feels responsible for the pasture, nobody is responsible for pasture. No controlled grazing or rotation plan exists at Jamoat level. The farmers do not organise which parts have been grazed and could be grazed next. The livestock owners pay very small rent so they do not value the pastureland and no money is available to implement projects (like installing water points).\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Each of the 60 households is paying 10-12 Somoni per year for grazing their cattle on the communal grazing land. Rent is paid per household not per amount of livestock. The total amount of pasture fees collect in Chukurak village is 600-700 Somoni per year. Neither establishment costs, nor investment or maintenance activities are done.\nNatural \/ human environment: Pastureland extends from the village in the valley, to the foothills. Half of the grazing area is on the riverbed and fan with very poor vegetation cover. The foothills show a high percentage of overgrazed, trampled, eroded area. Except for the water point near the village, no water and shady points exist for resting livestock. Three small water sources existed before, two of them where covered by the floods in spring of the current year. The other source produces a negligible amount of drinking water. 60 households graze their livestock, which totals 100 cows and 400 small livestock.

The water stored in these ponds is slowly released into a water body or it infiltrates into the groundwater \u2013 or both. Their primary functions are flood control, erosion control and water quality improvement.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Felix WitingThis documentation focuses on a detention basin constructed to hold surface runoff at the lowest point of an agricultural catchment. A well-designed detention pond is an effective flood control and landscape management measure. It stores surface runoff and releases it through controlled flow, infiltration, or evaporation (or a combination), and reduces nutrient inputs to the adjacent water body by filtering out sediment and nutrients through particle deposition, or nutrient uptake by plants. On average, water treatment in a detention pond can remove about 50-60% of suspended solids, 30-35% of total phosphorus and total nitrogen, and 25-65% of metals. Ponds also provide habitat for terrestrial, riparian and aquatic species. In addition to their ecological impact, they have an aesthetic and cultural value to society, for example, as a demonstration of effective sustainable water management.\nThe detention basin described here was constructed by excavating a new depression and ditch system. It consists of a 450 m long inlet channel, a 250 m\u00b2 pond, and an overflow channel that diverts excess water downstream to the nearest river (Schwarzer Sch\u00f6ps). However, there are no outlet structures for draining water that is captured in the pond (apart from the overflow). All the collected water seeps into the ground and soil particles settle. As a general rule, the size of such a pond should be 3-7% of the upstream catchment and should be able to hold at least the precipitation of a 1 in 30 year rainfall event. However, as the infiltration of the collected water is rather slow, the efficiency is reduced for successive events and overflowing is common. The depth should be between 1.2 m and 2.0 m. A deeper pond can lead to stratification and anoxic conditions, while a shallower pond may cause algal blooms and high biological activity in the summer. Water stored in the pond should remain for at least 20 days to ensure biological treatment.\nThe construction of the detention pond in this documentation was initiated as a compensation and replacement measure for the construction of a new road in 2016.  Accordingly, the road construction authority, the landscape conservation association and a farmer were involved in the implementation.\nAs usual with such measures there are drawbacks as well as positive impact for landowners. The measure consumes a lot of land, which automatically results in yield losses. It is expensive to build and not easy to construct - and requires the help of an engineering firm while also being time-consuming to maintain. Maintenance is required to sustain the benefits of the technology. For a pond such as that documented here, the following maintenance activities are necessary: during the first three years, maintenance includes mowing the surrounding green area and the dried out pond and channel three times per year. After the fourth year, maintenance includes (a) an annual function check, (b) a check for pest infestation every two years, and (c) suppression of excess woody growth every eight to ten years. Twice a year (mid-June and late August), the grass around the pond and in the intake channel is mowed and the clippings are removed. Shrubs and woody plants are maintained, especially by pruning woody plants (every 8 to 10 years) and coppicing sections of shrubs (every 10 to 15 years). In the long term, it may be necessary to remove the deposited sediments in order to maintain the retention capacity.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Conservation practices|Constructed wetlands","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204, 1198, 1208","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|Farm management|disaster management|field management|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"916, 920, 917, 918, 910, 1154, 914, 921","readiness_level":"9.

Crop establishment with minimum soil disturbance.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Olga VizitiuThe technology is applied in Braila region and is located in north-eastern part of Romanian Plain. It has an agricultural area of 387,646 ha (of which 350,001 ha are arable land), and has specific geomorphologic, hydrological and climatic conditions which need to use ameliorative agricultural systems. Within Braila County are distinguished the following relief units: Calmatui Plain, part of the Braila Plain (51% from County area) and the Floodplains of Danube (Big Island of Braila), Siret, Buzau and Calmatui rivers (49% from County area).\nBraila Plain is characterized by a specific micro-relief of Baragan type with large floodplains, poorly fragmented, with altitudes ranging between 20-25 m in the east part and 35-40 m to the west part, with soils mainly of chernozem type, formed on loess and loess deposits and which shows numerous small depression areas. Floodplains, areas adjacent to Danube, Siret, Buzau and Calmatui rivers are located at lower altitudes, ranging between 2-4 m and 13-15 m and are characterized by the presence of alluvial soils formed on river-limnic and alluvial deposits, with alternating of layers with different textures. According to United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Braila County is located in arid region with an average annual temperature of 10.9\u00b0C, long-term average annual precipitations (P) of 447 mm, potential evapotranspiration (ETP) of 705 mm (750-800 mm in dry years) and an average climatic water deficit of 258 mm (350-400 mm in dry years). The biophysical aridity index (P\/ETP = 0.50-0.65) places the Braila region in area with moderate risk to desertification. Both intensive and extensive farming systems are practiced within Braila County. Intensive agriculture, characterized by high inputs and yield levels, is realized on large vegetal farms. On the other hand, extensive agriculture, with low input and yield levels, is practiced by farmers on small vegetal farms, and is so-called the semi-subsistent agriculture.\nThe direct drill (no-till) conservative tillage technology is an agronomic measure. It is practiced on medium to large size farms (from around 50 ha to more than 1000 ha) within the North-Eastern part of the Romanian Plain. Over the past years some farmers have changed their farming system from conventional to conservative. The main element of the technology is that the farmers use special agricultural machinery for direct seeding, and other tillage operations from conventional system, such as ploughing and disking, are not performed anymore. Also, under no-till farming system, the soil surface remains covered on 30% with plant residues from the pre-emergent crop.\nThe main purpose of the technology is to mitigate soil structure degradation due to less tillage passes on the land. The technology is applied on arable land with annual crops. The farmers have begun to adopt this technology due to reduction in fuel consumption and working hours. For this reason, the technology has economic advantages. The no-tillage system requires a special direct seeding machine, and this can be expensive. So, most of the farmers don\u0027t buy it on their own, but they rent the seeding machine from other farmers.\nIn the land user\u0027s view, the strengths of the technology are as follows: reduced fuel consumption, improved soil water regime and tillage of larger field areas with less personnel and less trafficability and workability. In addition, the weaknesses of the technology reported by the land user might be: difficulties in weeds and pests control due to spread of straw-borne diseases which can be countered by in-depth knowledge of biocides, and high investment costs for equipment purchase which can be met by application for non-reimbursable funds or renting the equipment from other farmers or agricultural contractors.COMMENTS:Documentation of the technology is based on examination of field plots smaller than 0.1 km2.Main crops (cash and food crops): winter wheat, winter barley, spring barley, maizeSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Vehicles and machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1194, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|optimization of resource use for better production|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 922, 919, 910, 914, 915, 909, 908, 917, 925","readiness_level":"7.

The soil is covered with plant remainders.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Unknown UserThe farm portaited is located in a hilly area near Bern. It is cooperating with an other farm of the village so that in total 32 ha of arable land are cultivated. All crops except for potatoes and sugar beets are produced within the no-tillage system. So the area cultivated with the no-tillage system is about 26 ha. The farm is producing mainly fodder (maize, wheat) for pigs. Beside this potatoes and sugar beets are produced to be sold. A typical crop rotation consists of a root crop, followed by a winter grain and a green manure. There are major meadows, too.\nNo-tillage characterizes a cultivation system without ploughing or any other reworking of the soil. After the previous crop (Maize, grain) has been harvested, a total herbicide is applied and the seeds are brought directly into the soil with a special machine. A metal disk carves a narrow slit into the surface. Then the seeds are brought into the soil pneumatically. Finally, the slit is closed again by two wheels pressing on the surface.\nThe no-tillage system is used to reduce soil degradation, especially erosion. It enables a permanent cover of the soil surface, which reduces sealing and crusting. Since they are not disturbed by ploughing anymore, there are more earthworms in the soil. Their activity can slowly reduce compaction and improve the soil structure. This leads to better infiltration rates and also to a higher water storage capacity. Less water remains on the soil surface, so soil loss can be reduced.\nThe no-tillage system requires a special direct seeding machine. This machine is very expensive, so most farmers don\u2019t buy it on their own but task a contractor with the seeding. On the other hand, certain machines from conventional agriculture are not needed anymore (plough, harrow, rotary tiller etc.). Furthermore, working hours and fuel can be saved. In some cantons of switzerland no-tillage agriculture is also subsidised. For this reason, the method holds economic advantages, too. \nIn the beginning crop yield may be reduced by up to 10%. The rebuilding of the soil structure requires a certain time, depending on the state of the soil at the time of transition. However, this was not the case for the farm portaited here: Already in the first year there were very good crop yields, although the probability for crop loss is higher in the no-tillage system. Competition between the crops and weeds can be too strong if the total herbicide is applied under wet conditions. In addition drying of the soil in spring is often delayed. Thus the plants may face too wet conditions.COMMENTS:The farm owns 0.27 km2. For reasons of rationalization it is working together with another farm. Together they have 0.32 km2.

The purpose of the technology is to provide safe housing, safe shelter for livestock, food security and income generation for ten families, including persons with disabilities. \nThe main components of the technology are: \n1) The raising of a piece of land by seven feet (213cm), to three feet (91cm) above expected highest flood levels. Solid soil was banked up to encircle a 30\u0027000 square feet (roughly 50x57m) piece of land and then the space within was filled up with sand collected from a nearby river bank. A one-foot layer of solid soil was added to cover the entire area.    \n2) The protection of the raised land from soil erosion during floods by planting a combination of deep-rooted fruit- and medicine trees around the border of the raised land. The trees include a number of different types of deep-rooted and light-rooted fruit trees and one type of medicine tree, Azadirachta Indica, locally known as \u0022Neem\u0022. In addition, the slope of the border area was covered by grass turf to protect the soil from being washed out by rain. Two types of deep-rooted and flood resistant grasses were used. A drainage system was installed to facilitate water runoff.\n3) The planting of a 150 square feet (14m2) commonly used homestead vegetable garden at the center of the cluster village. The cultivated vegetables include red spinach, jute leaf, basella leaf, spinach, radish, cabbage, okra, bottle-guts, cucumber and beans, allowing for a summer and a winter harvest. Together with the fruit trees, the vegetable garden provides food security during prolonged flooding. They also provide improved nutrition and income generating opportunities through selling of a part of the harvest in the market.\n4) Making the village accessible for persons with disabilities through different accessibility measures, including the construction of a ramp, connecting the cluster village entrance with the road, and of accessible common Water-, Sanitation- and Hygiene (WASH) facilities, including a latrine, deep bore hole water source and water storage tank. \n5) Installation of a solar panel to ensure uninterrupted, flood-resilient power supply. The level of power supply is sufficient to ensure coverage of electricity needs during flood season, when regular supply is around 15% below annual average.\nThe Cluster village was constructed as part of a disaster risk reduction project by CDD (Center for Disability in Development) from Bangladesh, with the support of CBM (Christoffel Blindenmission), an international development organization and funded by a donor from Germany. The main cost for inputs were provided to the land users by the project, including rent of construction machinery, paid labor, soil and construction material for the ramp and WASH facilities. The land users contributed labor and seedlings for the planning of the border trees and the homestead vegetable garden. \nThe main benefits of the technology from the perspective of land users are the protection it provides for houses and livestock, which would otherwise be in danger of loss during floods. The availability of food, water and electricity allows land users to remain in their homes during floods and avoid evacuation and the risk associated with it, including for example protection risks or the risk of theft. The flood protected vegetable gardens and fruit trees provide a year-round, sustainable source of food and income, providing food security and improved nutrition. The Neem tree provides medical and hygiene uses of the branches and leaves. \nThe cluster village is used as a safe space for the land users and other members of the community and their livestock during floods. Land users who are persons with disabilities or elderly benefit from the accessible infrastructure. With multiple families sharing land, the cluster villages provides optimal utilization of land resources. An additional benefit mentioned by land users is that the joint use by multiple families led to a more progressive social culture.COMMENTS:Kani Charitabari, Horipur Union, Sundargonj  sub district, Gaibandha District.Number of growing seasons per year: 2 (Summer and winter)\nLivestock density : Livestock are available in every household.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation|Solar-powered farming systems|Geospatial technologies|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204, 1044, 1045, 1052, 1015","use_cases":"Farm management|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|income increase|Production|crop production|animal production|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|Supply chain management|support to consumption and nutrition","use_cases_id":"910, 1154, 916, 918, 1180, 897, 898, 899, 920, 921, 939, 944","readiness_level":"7.

Poor crop rotation is one of the major causes of degradation. Crop rotation \u201cwheat-cotton-wheat\u201d is applied On farm fields: for several years in a row cotton has been cultivated after cotton, or wheat after wheat. After harvesting of winter wheat, plant residues are removed from the fields for economic needs. The field remains fallow since June.  The bare land dries up, loses its structure and resistance to soil erosion. Salts from groundwater are pulled up and accumulate in the root zone, which leads to soil salinization  and production  decrease. Crops diversification improves the existing crop rotation by re-sowing after winter wheat legumes and crops as a green manure\/ fertilizer. The improved crop rotation includes the following steps- \u0022 winter wheat-legumes (mash, beans) - green manure (rye, etc.) - cotton\u00bb: Next, the cycle repeats. The field is under vegetation all year round, unproductive evaporation from the soil surface is reduced, which slows down the development of secondary salinization processes. Plant residues of winter wheat, legumes and green manure plants plowed into the soil replenish humus reserves. The Technology allows to get two crops (wheat and legumes) during the year, which provides land users with additional income from re-culture and contributes to strengthening the country\u0027s food security.\nCosts of inputs needed for establishment:\nThe cultivation of repeated crops and green manure is usual, as for other row crops, therefore, local land users are well aware of the methods of preparation and tillage of the technology for growing repeated crops.  The Technology does not require large additional financial and labor costs and includes chiseling, harrowing, sowing, cutting irrigation furrows, irrigation, inter-row cultivation. Growing a second crop and green manure will require financial imputs for seed acquisition, sowing and crop care. However, the income received from the re-crop crop (mung bean, beans) is about 4 million Uzbek soums \/ ha, and fully covers these costs\nNatural and human environment:\nThe technology has been tested on irrigated lands in various agro-climatic zones of Uzbekistan: Kashkadarya, Jizzakh region and in South Karakalpakstan (Beruni, Turtkul and Ellikkala regions). Technology received government support. According to the Decree of the President of the country in 2018, it is planned to place repeated crops of legumes after harvesting winter wheat for 374 thousand hectares.

In this case quinoa was introduced as an intercrop for lentil. The yield of lentil is not reduced; hence the system becomes more productive, profitable and resilient with the introduction of quinoa.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Joren VerbistIn the semi-arid regions of Morocco agricultural production is unstable, and yields are declining as consequence of climate change. Climate change leads to more irregular rainfall and more frequent extreme weather events. There is a need, where possible, to intensify agricultural systems while improving food security - through increasing the resilience of the overall system.\nCultivating lentils is common practice in rural Morocco. To intensify this cropping system, taking into account the e\ufb00ects of climate change, the International Centre for Agricultural Research Dry Areas (ICARDA) introduced quinoa into the common lentil production system. Importantly, quinoa does not a\ufb00ect the yields of lentil because it does not signi\ufb01cantly compete for water and nutrients. With two crops harvested from the same piece of land, overall farm pro\ufb01t increases. Furthermore, the cultivation of two crops creates a more resilient overall system because the farmer is not dependent on one single crop. Additionally, as quinoa is harvested later than lentil, the soil is covered for a longer period, consequently protecting it from degradation, hence soil quality is improved. In addition, lentils are leguminous, \ufb01xing nitrogen in the soil, thus improving soil conditions for growth.\nHowever the technology has some potential drawbacks. Firstly, in Morocco, the market for quinoa is not well developed, hence achieving a good market price could be problematic if planted at scale. Secondly, in years of extreme droughts, quinoa requires supplementary irrigation, especially during crop establishment. This is often inaccessible, resulting in poor crop establishment and low yield. Thirdly, if planted in small plots there may be risks of free grazing livestock as well as pest and insect infestations. This can be overcome by community farming and pest control.\nIn 2020 and 2021, ICARDA tested this Diversi\ufb01ed Cropping System on a trial \ufb01eld of half a hectare, in an area with average annual precipitation of 400 mm. DCS is implemented in the following order of activities. The \ufb01eld is prepared by ploughing. In December, lentils are mechanically seeded. Two rows of lentils are planted 15 cm apart. The spacing between each two-row pair is roughly 90 cm. Compound fertilizer is applied during the seeding. In January, a herbicide is sprayed to control grassy weeds. The \ufb01eld is mechanically weeded twice, in mid-January and then again in February. \nThe quinoa is then seeded at the end of February: also in paired lines (two rows at 20 cm apart) and also with compound fertilizer. Each pair of quinoa lines is planted between pairs of lentils. Because the quinoa is planted within an already growing crop of lentils, this form of intercropping is termed \u0022relay planting\u0022. \nThe quinoa is manually weeded in March. In April, the lentils are manually harvested and mechanically threshed. A single spray of insecticide is applied in April-May. Finally, in June, the quinoa is mechanically harvested.\nThis documentation illustrated an ICARDA innovation which is accessible since there are no establishment events and costs. This Diversi\ufb01ed Cropping System improves a traditional system by introducing an additional crop, resulting in better farm income and more resilience.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Harvesting and processing equipment|Nature-based solutions|Species diversification|Integrated management systems","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1192, 1196, 1200, 1197","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|field management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 918, 921, 917, 915, 912, 914","readiness_level":"7.

To intensify this cropping system, the International Centre for Agricultural Research Dry Areas (ICARDA) introduced chickpeas (Cicer arietinum) as a relay intercrop into the common lentil production system. Because chickpeas are planted within an already growing crop of lentils, this form of intercropping is termed \u0022relay planting\u0022. Importantly, chickpeas do not a\ufb00ect the yields of lentils (0.837 + 0.19 t ha-1 yield in sole vs. 0.808 + 0.159 t ha-1 in intercrop) because they do not signi\ufb01cantly compete for water and nutrients. With two crops harvested from the same piece of land, overall farm pro\ufb01ts increase. Furthermore, this creates a more resilient production system because the farmer is not dependent on a single crop. Additionally, including chickpeas as a relay-intercrop extends the cropping season and prolongs the period where the soil is covered, consequently protecting it from degradation. An added advantage is that both chickpeas and lentils are leguminous, nitrogen-\ufb01xing crops that can improve soil fertility. Also, both crops have high cultural and culinary value locally. However, the technology has potential drawbacks as in years of extreme droughts, chickpeas require supplementary irrigation, especially during establishment. This is often unavailable to local farmers and may result in poor crop establishment and low yields.\nIn 2020-2022, ICARDA tested this Diversi\ufb01ed Cropping System (DCS) on a trial \ufb01eld of half a hectare, in an area with average annual precipitation of 390 mm (based on 40 years of data). The system is implemented as follows. First, the \ufb01eld is prepared by ploughing. In December, lentils are mechanically seeded. Two rows of lentils are planted 15 cm apart. The spacing between each two-row pair is roughly 90 cm. Compound fertilizer is applied during seeding. In January, an herbicide is sprayed to control grassy weeds. The \ufb01eld is mechanically weeded twice, in mid-January and then again in February. Chickpeas are sown at the end of February also in paired lines (two rows 20 cm apart) also with compound fertilizer. Each pair of chickpea lines is planted between pairs of lentils. In March, the plots are manually weeded, and in April, the lentils are manually harvested and mechanically threshed. A single spray of insecticide is applied in April-May. Finally, in June, the chickpeas are mechanically harvested and have an average yield of 1.1 + 0.146 t ha-1.\nThis documentation illustrates an ICARDA innovation that is accessible since there are no establishment events and costs. This Diversi\ufb01ed Cropping System improves a traditional system by introducing an additional crop, resulting in higher farm income and resilience to variable weather.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Harvesting and processing equipment|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|New business models","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1192, 1196, 1203, 1200, 1206, 1076, 1211","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 918, 917, 921, 914, 912, 915","readiness_level":"7.

In this case, the cash crop of onions was introduced as an intercrop for lentils. The yield of lentils is not reduced; hence the system becomes more productive, profitable and resilient with the introduction of onions.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Joren VerbistIn the semi-arid regions of Morocco agricultural production is increasingly unstable as consequence of changing climate, variable rainfall and more frequent extreme weather events. There is a need, where possible, to intensify agricultural systems while improving food security - and increasing the resilience of the overall system.\nCultivating lentils in cereal-based systems is common practice in rural Morocco. To intensify this cropping system, taking into account the e\ufb00ects of climate change, the International Centre for Agricultural Research Dry Areas (ICARDA) introduced onions into the common lentil production system. This was a part of research trials to find suitability and economic profitability of crop rotation systems. The introduction of onions as a relay intercrop within lentils has multiple benefits and advantages. Firstly, with two crops are harvested from the same piece of land, thus overall farm pro\ufb01t increases. Secondly, the cultivation of two crops creates a more resilient overall system because the farmer is not dependent on one single crop. Thirdly, as onions are harvested later than lentils, the soil is covered for a longer period, consequently protecting it from degradation, hence soil quality is improved. Fourthly, lentils are leguminous, \ufb01xing nitrogen in the soil, thus improving soil fertility. Lastly, the market linkage for onions is very good in Morocco because it is a commonly cultivated crop with high cultural and culinary value: indeed, onions are a cash crop. \nHowever, the technology has potential drawbacks. Firstly, onions require supplementary irrigation if there is not enough late season rainfall. Highly efficient irrigation systems (e.g. drip) require initial investment. In this case the Moroccan government supports 80% of the investment cost for installing drip irrigation. This establishment activity is thus a one-time cost. Secondly, if planted in small plots there may be risks of free grazing livestock as well as pest and insect infestations. This can be overcome by community farming and pest control.\nIn 2020 and 2021, ICARDA tested this Diversi\ufb01ed Cropping System on a trial \ufb01eld of half a hectare, in an area with average annual precipitation of 400 mm. DCS is implemented in the following order of activities. The \ufb01eld is prepared by ploughing. In December, lentils are mechanically seeded. Two rows of lentils are planted 15 cm apart. The spacing between each two-row pair is roughly 95 cm. Compound fertilizer is applied during the seeding. In January, a single spray of herbicide is applied to control grassy weeds. The \ufb01eld is mechanically weeded twice, in mid-January and then again in February.\nOnion seedlings are raised in January. These are then transplanted in March: also in paired lines (two rows at 20 cm apart).  Compound fertilizer is applied before transplanting. Each pair-row of onion seedlings is planted between two pair-rows of lentils. Because the onions are planted within an already growing crop of lentils, this form of intercropping is termed \u0022relay planting\u0022.\nThe onions are manually weeded in March-April. In April, the lentils are manually harvested and mechanically threshed. Finally, in June, the onions are manually harvested.\nDuring a period from March until May, the onions are irrigated three times. Because the irrigation is just partial, it is termed \u0022supplementary irrigation\u0022. The average irrigation amount per event was 15 millimetres. This is done through drip irrigation.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Integrated management systems|Species diversification|Institutional|Partnerships|Research and development collaborations|Financial|Innovative insurance products|Policy|Incentive-based Policy Instruments|Market-based instruments","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1203, 1197, 1200, 1116, 1135, 1118, 1058, 1069, 1095, 1152, 2098","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|optimization of resource use for better production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|improving soil management practices|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 1180, 912, 916, 918, 909, 915, 921, 908, 920","readiness_level":"7.

Biogas is a renewable energy or gas produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Most people in Uganda, especially in rural areas, don\u2019t have access to electricity and mostly rely on firewood and charcoal (mostly in urban areas). This has led to depletion of forests since these forests are the main supply of wood fuel. The domestic biogas technique uses fresh cow dung to produce methane gas for lighting and heating.\nThis technology is viable for smallholder farmers with livestock that are capable of producing 25 kg of fresh dung per day, typically about five indigenous cows. This makes the technology suitable for smallholders in developing countries. Fresh cow dung is collected and mixed with water at a ratio of 1:1, depending on the thickness of the dung, to produce a free-flowing mixture. The mixture is poured into the digester where microbes break it down under an oxygen-free environment and in the process release methane gas which is harvested in a cylinder and piped straight into the home for lighting and\/ or heating.\nDimensions for the Digester (4m in diameter and 3 m in depth). Overflow tank\/ Outlet  is 2 meters by 2 meters. Materials used in the construction of the plant include sand, cement, bricks, iron rods, gravel and water. Biogas stove, lamp and its appliances and gas controller or pressure gauge are connected after the construction of the biogas plant which can be purchased from specified outlets on the urban markets. \nProduction and use of biogas protects the environment through reduced tree cutting and emission of harmful greenhouse gases (GHG). It also eases the workload of rural women and children by providing a safe and cheap source of fuel since it reduces the risk encountered by children and women looking for firewood and spares their time that would otherwise be spent in the process. The bi-product (bio-slurry) removed from the digester at the end of the process is used as organic fertilizer which boosts crop productivity and is a highly nutritious feed supplement for animals.\nThe technology has safety issues especially on the side of children when it comes to the flammable gas.COMMENTS:1.2899 , 34.3551The technology is applied around the land user\u0027s homestead.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation|Biofuels from agricultural waste","type_id":"993, 1044, 1047","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change mitigation|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact|Production|crop production|animal production|optimization of resource use for better production|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"916, 919, 925, 897, 898, 899, 909, 921","readiness_level":"7.

It is made of stone, concrete, gabions and wooden bars and serves as a permanent barrier. In this particular site stone is used as the structure is masonry. The technology is applied in areas where there are concentrated flows of water or runoff. The double basin masonry check dam is sited across a slope or a deep gully to slow water flow and capture sediment from upstream in the basins and behind the structure, thereby preventing expansion of the gully. The width of a check dam is variable. This particular structure is 14 meter wide, three meters deep and about 52 meters long. By helping to fill up the gully with sediment, it leads to rehabilitation and makes productive use of the area for growing trees, forage, and other plants. Apart from reducing the speed of surface runoff, the structure also promotes water infiltration, and recharges the groundwater reserves in the aquifer.\nThe main inputs necessary to build the check dams are financial resources, technical skills, skilled and unskilled labour, and construction materials including sand, stone, cement, water and other materials. Furthermore, construction tools such as a theodolite, line level, string, hammers, spades, hoes, and other tools are essential for design \u0026amp; construction. Technical skills for designing and profiling, and further capacity-building training are essential also. Application of the technology is also supported by satellite image and ground truthing to ensure the precision of siting.\nThe agropastoralists in the dry basin areas are pleased to see a huge movement of the soil arrested by the structure. The reduced expansion of the gully into the heart of the farm and grazing lands raises hopes of their land become productive and remaining so for generations to come. This hope and expectation have motivated them to welcome the intervention and develop an understanding of the actual benefits accrued from it. This leads to their support for the construction efforts. The disadvantages are that the technology is labour and resource-intensive which can be unaffordable for resource-poor agropastoralist communities living in food-insecure areas where rainfall is unreliable. This may make the adoption of the technology difficult to establish and nurture on their own without outside support.COMMENTS:Locating the check dam closer to each other may help to stop the damage of heavy and concentrated flood moving in the drainage basin.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Traditional and indigenous practices|Geospatial technologies|Digital technologies|Remote sensing","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204, 1206, 1052, 1015, 1034","use_cases":"Farm management|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|field management|Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation","use_cases_id":"910, 1154, 916, 920, 921, 914, 897, 1186, 918, 919","readiness_level":"7.

Its basic function is to allow the passage of drainage water, contaminated with nutrients and pesticides, through a container with pollutant-reducing agents. Bioreactors are usually located at the bottom of agricultural drainage structures on the drains or in connection with drainage outlets. Ideally, the biofilter is located on a site that is no longer part of the cultivated land or is under permanent grassland.\nIn principle, two biofilter solutions are possible.  In the case of low and regular drainage flows, the drainage section is directly replaced by a biofilter. With higher flows and in the case of rapid response of the drainage structure to rainfall-runoff episodes, the biofilter is placed parallel to the outlet drain or is located under the drainage outlet (if ambient conditions allow).  Such a design includes a distribution structure (preferably located in a drainage manhole) and a drainage pipe to allow safe bypassing of a portion of the elevated drainage outlet, to maintain the residence time of the water in the biofilter and thus its corresponding efficiency. \nThe biofilter may be designed as closed or open. A closed biofilter is completely buried and normal tillage can take place. An open biofilter lacks the advantage of an undisturbed terrain but has the advantage of benefitting from plants that enhance the purification of drainage water by bacteria living on their roots. \nThe installation always consists of a bed or container in which the reducing agent is enclosed, ensuring the isolation of the agent from the surrounding soil and water. In the case of a smaller sized closed biofilter, a plastic container can be used, while in the case of a larger or open design, plastic film can be used as a bed. Various materials can be used as biofilter fillings, or substrates, both individually and in combination. In most cases, the reducing agent is carbonaceous, with denitrification mediated by chemo-organotrophic bacteria.\nIn terms of N-NO3 removal, the most effective are wood chips, which have a high hydraulic conductivity and a C:N ratio of 30:1 to 300:1. In particular, chips from poplar, pine and larch are suitable. For the removal of pesticides or biopharmaceuticals, then biochar (biochar) and lignite are suitable as natural and readily available materials. A combination of materials can also be used. For example, the addition of biochar to the wood chips will increase the efficiency of the bioreactor in degrading pesticides, or the charge can be combined with an inorganic substrate (sand, vermiculite), which is added to prevent undesirable settling, reduce hydraulic conductivity and at the same time mechanically purify the drainage water.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Bioremediation and phytoremediation|Environmental biotechnology|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 994, 1000, 999, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|minimize pesticide use|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"916, 920, 926, 921, 917","readiness_level":"6.

It is protected from the sea by a wall called \u2018dyke\u2019. The reason for reclamation by drainage and walls was to make use of the fertile soil for intensive cropland or pastures. In the Landkreis Aurich region, agriculture is the most important form of land use: it is the main source of income, supplemented by tourism.\nPurpose of the Technology: However, in anticipation of the expected increase in winter precipitation due to climate change, extra freshwater discharge will need to be dealt with. Furthermore, the periods when natural discharge of freshwater into the sea can occur is likely to become shorter, due to the sea level rising \u2013 again as a result of climate change. Consequently, in autumn and winter, more freshwater will have to be pumped into the sea rather than being discharged naturally during low tides.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: A dense drainage network enables intensive agriculture on the landward side of the primary sea wall. In total, one third of the Krummh\u00f6rn community\u2019s land is used for crops and one third as pasture. Drainage water from land which lies below sea level is pumped into the main drainage channels - which are at higher elevations and discharge naturally into the sea during low tides.\nNatural \/ human environment: During storm tides when the sea level is high, large amounts of excess drainage water need to be pumped into the sea instead of naturally discharging. However, with climate change the present drainage network will no longer be capable of discharging all of the excess freshwater as a result of increased precipitation and sea level rise. This will require considerable investments in higher pumping capacities and an adapted drainage system with increased dimensions of ditches, as well as additional ditches in areas with a high flooding risk.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 33.7 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Flood events and droughts may substantially disrupt the current land use system in the future and lead to higher drainage costs and higher economic risks for agricultural production.

The quality of water was deteriorating due to poor sanitation and seepage around the spring. The spring was located near to Dhotra village at Barbot sub-settlement, Kabhrepalanchok district. About five households depended on the spring for their drinking water supplies with a further 10 using it regularly and 10-15 using it occasionally during the dry season.\nThe main purpose of implementing the technology was to improve the quality of drinking water in the spring by preventing it from being contaminated by surface runoff during the rainy season. This technology has long been implemented across Nepal\u2019s midhills. In this case a development project (PARDYP) mobilised the users and provided them with technical and material support to make the improvements.\nA spring user group was formed. With project help, it built a walled structure (a spring box) over the spring and check dams around the spring, and planted grasses around the spring box and trees in the catchment. These measures prevented the direct flow of surface water into the spring thus reducing contamination and turbidity. Users built a 1.8m long, 1m wide and 1.5m high spring box with a zinc sheeted roof. Check dams were built across the surrounding gullies and rills. A main 2.5m long, 0.5m wide, and 1m high check dam was constructed near the source to prevent surface runoff from entering the spring. A drainage channel was made to drain off wastewater. Vetiver grass seedlings were planted around the spring box and trees were planted in the adjoining catchment. These activities were carried out at the beginning of the rainy season.\nThis technology is simple and durable and the only maintenance needed is to keep the surroundings clean and to repair any damage.\nThe case study area receives about 1200 mm of annual precipitation of which about 80% occurs during the monsoon season (June to September).

This saves water and maximum benefit is achieved with a minimum of water. In this system, plant roots receive water at the right time and in sufficient quantities. Labour expenses with the system are low, but the first investment expenses are high. At current prices, it costs about 2000 US$ per ha, which varies with the density of the network required for the specific crop.\nPurpose of the Technology: Depending on the size of the field to be watered, a main network of PVC pipes able to cope with the pressure necessary to convey water to secondary\/lateral pipe systems is established. These pipes are mostly 2.5cm in diameter and have dripfeed points at their ends. The system is suitable for water conservation, because it enables watering to be focused where required, i.e. close to the root zone of the crops, but without wasting water. However, increased use in rainfed areas will increase the overall water demand. From the viewpoint of surface sealing of the soil, it has advantages since it causes wetting only in limited areas. Problems such as salinization and leaching of nutrients are also reduced by limiting the watering. At the same time, the method considerably increases farm income as excessive watering is avoided.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The basic land use types targeted with the technology are perennial tree crops (i.e. orchard and stony fruit crops) and annual crops with individual plant stems such as potato, maize and sunflower. Maize is used as fodder. It is particularly useful in arid and semi-arid regions where evapotranspiration is high, surface waters are scarce and groundwater is threatened due to high exploitation. It grows under all topographic conditions.\nNatural \/ human environment: From the viewpoint of human environment, the technology is profitable for farmers who have a pressurized pumping system connected to a groundwater source. The basic costs are for the planning of the irrigation system, the hard PVC pipes and its set-up in the field. These services are provided by specialized companies, while the maintenance of the system can be done by the farmers themselves. The volume of the crops produced in this system is high and intended for commercial use.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 1 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The main problem in the Konya closed basin is the rapidly dropping groundwater levels. For this reason electricity expenses for watering is intolerably increasing for the farmers and groundwater resources are irreversibly rapidly decreasing.

Economic problems, regional reforms and shortage of investments in municipal water supply infrastructure led to problems of water quality and quantity of available water for industrial, agricultural and domestic uses. The situation is getting worse with the effects of regional climate change. Especially during summer, the study region has problems with shortage of water not just for irrigation of agricultural fields, or gardens, but also for domestic use. In such situations, more efficient water use is required through introducing water-saving technologies. One of these well-known irrigation technologies is drip irrigation. Small quantities of water are directly delivered to the plants by a pipe system. This technology is the most effective from the point of view of green water use efficiency. Correct application of drip irrigation technology drastically decreases water losses by runoff and evaporation as well as deep percolation to soil depths inaccessible to root uptake. Water can be provided to plants from surface water reservoirs, water tanks or groundwater wells through a network of plastic pipes (under low water pressure) and delivered through a water drip system. The flow rate can be adjusted to the needs of the particular stage of plant growth, to soil hydraulic properties and to the prevailing weather conditions. The low-pressure supply system can be operated using a header tank or directly by using a water pump to raise water from nearby surface water storage or a groundwater well.\nThe aim of this technology is to show the effectiveness of freshwater usage in irrigating vegetables (tomatoes, peppers) at the scale of subsidiary plots or small irrigation systems (several ha in size) in a region with scarce water resources both as a water-saving measure and an eco-friendly alternative to furrow irrigation. Owing to the relative narrowness of the drip feeders, they are prone to blockages from organic matter, mineral particles or dissolved compounds. To prolong the lifetime of the drip irrigation equipment, it needs to be maintained using preventive and remedial measures such as visual inspection of pipes and water supply sources, filter installations as well as flushing the tubes and drip emitters to remove deposits.\nIn general, a number of medium-scale farmers are using furrow irrigation of vegetables as their main agricultural activity. Drip-irrigation technology was tested with four families and compared to furrow irrigation in order to compare water consumption (water use efficiency as rate of yield and volume of water used for irrigation) as well as its impact on soil degradation and ground-water. The water use efficiency of drip irrigation is 3 - 10 times higher than that of furrow irrigation, depending on local conditions and qualification of furrow irrigators. Furthermore, this technology avoids water loss through soil surface evaporation, percolation to deep soil layers and ground water, and runoff into near water bodies (causing pollution by chemicals used for agricultural activities at irrigated fields like fertilizers and plant protectors). The negative impact of furrow irrigation on soil productivity is usually very high due to soil erosion.\nExperimentations and demonstration of drip irrigation were done at two levels. The first level involved large-scale farms with the aim of demonstrating the considerable gains to be made through the efficient use of water, through the development of representative experimental plots on fields used for furrow irrigation by two farmers. The second level was developed for small-scale farmers and householders to demonstrate the efficiency of water saving in gardening.COMMENTS:Technology now is in testing mode.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Scarcity of fresh water resources, change of local seasonal climate patterns related to change in rainfall, scarcity of freshwater resources, soil salinization, disappearance of some species of flora and fauna\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Scarcity of fresh water resources, change of local seasonal climate patterns related to change in rainfall, scarcity of freshwater resources, soil salinization, disappearance of some species of flora and fauna\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: Some changes in the cropping system can be seen as there are several years of water shortage can be observed.\nLivestock is grazing on crop residuesSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|field management|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 920, 909, 910, 914, 918, 921","readiness_level":"7.

The FFDI systems were distributed to 60 women-led households in Khatlon province of Tajikistan. Additionally FFDI systems were installed in eight demonstration plots of organizations and state institutes. The beneficiaries were identified according to selection criteria to best contribute to food security and livelihood improvement through these affordable irrigation solutions. They were trained in irrigation and crop husbandry through a workshop, and their irrigation and plant production activities were monitored. Despite problems with pest management, vulnerable women-headed farms in the climate change affected areas increased crop productivity by 50% and harvested 2 crops a year. Vegetables were the crops of focus, and the average area irrigated was 300m2. Moreover, the application of the mulching helped to preserve more moisture and it helped to reduce irrigation norms by 25-30 per cent. For mulching, wheat straw and\/or flax straw with a thickness of 7-10 cm was used. The FFDI system is affordable, does not require pumping, is easy to install and move, is easily adjustable and is supported by an installation kit.

But there are two main problems: shortage of water and salinization of the soil. Farmers who use the traditional flood irrigation method, and don\u2019t have a drainage system, tend to abandon their fields when they become too saline - and then they look for new land to cultivate. A combination of mulching and drip irrigation can be very effective but still needs careful management. Drip irrigation helps to save water for farmers - and for the environment. But it is still very important to install a drainage system to dispose of surplus water in order to reduce the risk of salinization of the soils. Every four cotton rows are covered with transparent polyethylene film and as a result approximately 80% of the ground surface is covered by the plastic mulch. Plastic mulch and drip lines are placed with a specially equipped tractor.\nPurpose of the Technology: Low temperatures and dry soil at sowing, in combination with soil salinity, hinder early plant growth. Plastic mulching increases soil temperature, reduces the need for irrigation, and also helps control salinity in the root zone and suppresses weeds, thereby increasing yields by 10\u201330% (and improving quality also) (Wang, R. et al., 2011). In the first stages after sowing the climate is particularly cold. With plastic mulching the cotton plants can be sown earlier, because the soil will not cool down during the night as much as without plastic mulch.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: For the establishment of the new technology of drip irrigation under plastic mulch, it is simultaneously essential to install a drainage system to avoid raising the groundwater level and causing salinity. For the installation of the drip lines, the transparent plastic film and the seeding, a tractor and a special tool for the installationis needed: one acre can be installed in a day. After the emerging of the cotton plants, holes must be cut in the plastic film so that the cotton plants can emerge. After harvesting, the drip lines and the plastic film must be collected and recycled. If the plastic is left behind it will pollute the soils and injure livestock if they eat it. Furthermore plastic residues in the soil can reduce subsequent yields, as roots are physically inhibited. After the collection of the plastic residues, if there is no adequate drainage system, the field needs to be flooded to flush the salt layer, which has accumulated below the root zone, deeper into the soil. If the field is not flooded the salt will negatively affect the next years\u2019 cotton plantation.\nNatural \/ human environment: Southern Xinjiang is an arid region with 50 to 90 mm per year. Most precipitation occurs between June and August. It is classified as a temperate cold desert climate. For drip irrigation under plastic mulch, it is principally surface water that is used, which is delivered to the field via channels from reservoirs to the fields. The reservoirs are filled in summer with the floods along the Tarim River. The untreated surface water is of poor quality - for agricultural use only. For drip irrigation, the water needs to be treated to avoid blocking the drip outlets.

Many people are dependent on the agricultural sector. Typically, barley is cultivated and used for fodder or sale. Barley production is increasingly in danger of failure because of droughts worsened by climate change. Therefore, a new and drought tolerant barley variety was sought. NARS developed such seed by using germplasm that was made available by the International Center of Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA).\nAs adoption of technologies is often the most difficult part of the innovation process, special care was put into this. It was found that combining different extension methods ranging from technical training to information through SMS led to the highest adoption. And solely focusing on the technical training was the most cost-effective approach. The targeted beneficiaries were small-scale farmers in central Tunisia. Their farm enterprises consist predominantly of small ruminant and cereal production. On average their farm size is 5 hectares and their flocks comprise 20 to 40 sheep and\/or goats.\nThe benefits of the new, drought tolerant variety \u0027Kounouz\u0027 encompass enhanced farm income through reduced production risks and increased yields because Kounouz is better adapted to the semi-arid conditions. It makes more efficient use of water, therefore, Kounouz can produce grain with 300 millimetres of rainfall, whereas the alternative varieties (e.g., Rihane) need at least 350. Under favourable conditions (around 400 millimetres) Kounouz has higher yields than currently available varieties. Kounouz reaches 3 tonnes per hectare of grain, and 4.5 tonnes of straw.   \nThe adoption of this variety has already made significant strides. By 2019, approximately 617 tonnes of certified seeds were available. This accomplishment was the result of successful collaboration between a large-scale cooperative, COSEM, and a private seed company, TUNIFERT. Presently, two more cooperatives, namely SOSEM and CCSPS, have also become actively involved.\nIt is worth noting that a mere 5% of the Kounouz seeds are estimated to be sourced from certified suppliers, with the majority being multiplied on individual farms. Consequently, it is estimated that the cultivation of Kounouz now spans over 20,000 hectares.\nTo further facilitate widespread adoption, the establishment of demonstration plots within target regions is imperative. This approach allows farmers, seed companies, and cooperatives to witness production first-hand and become persuaded of its benefits. However, the provision of adequate technical support and comprehensive coaching to farmers is indispensable.\nThe recommended cultivation practices for Kounouz are typically outlined as follows:\nField preparation, involving ploughing, is initiated at the onset of the rainy season, which generally occurs between September and October. Sowing activities take place in the months of November to December. In order to effectively manage weed growth, herbicide applications are undertaken from December to January. The quantity of herbicide utilized is contingent upon various factors, including climatic conditions, precipitation levels, and the preceding crop type. Notably, cultivating cereal crops after another cereal crop tends to result in a higher weed population compared to the cultivation of legume-cereal rotations. Depending on the geographical location of the farm, the application of mineral fertilizer is scheduled for the months of January to February in North-Western Tunisia. This timeline ensures that the fertilizer is strategically administered to optimize crop growth and yield.\nWe would like to thank BMZ\/ GIZ who supported this innovation through their contributions to the \u201cMind the Gap\u201d project as well as Tunisian NARES (INRAT, AVFA, OEP, CRDA) for co-implementing project activitiesCOMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Nature-based solutions|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)|SMS|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 994, 1196, 1199, 1037, 1015","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 910, 914, 909, 916, 918, 920, 1180, 912, 915","readiness_level":"9.

Limited water availability and higher temperatures disrupt crop growth and heighten the vulnerability of plants to pests such as the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor). This leads to increased risks of crop damage, reduced yields, and economic losses in these regions.\nGenetically improving crop varieties can help overcome these issues by making crops more resilient. An international collaboration led by the International Center of Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA-Morocco) has delivered six ground-breaking new durum wheat and barley varieties tolerant to increasingly severe droughts ravaging the region. Improvement is performed through Molecular Breeding which consists of markers to select specific traits and conventional phenotypic.\nThis case study revolves around an improved durum wheat variety named Jawahir. The main advantages of this variety are:\n\u2022Cost savings: Jawahir\u0027s suitability for zero tillage helps to eliminate the need for ploughing, reducing the associated costs for farmers.\n\u2022Disease and pest resistance: Jawahir\u0027s resistance to diseases and pests, including the Hessian fly, minimizes the expenses related to fungicides and insecticides.\n\u2022Higher grain yield: Compared to competing varieties (like Karim and Kanakis), Jawahir can yield an additional 700 kilograms per hectare under dry conditions, increasing farmers\u0027 productivity and potential income.\n\u2022Enhanced straw yield: Jawahir also produces an additional 500 kilograms of straw compared to competing varieties during drought, providing additional feed for fodder and for mulching under conservation agriculture systems. \nJawahir was introduced in the Settat-Safi region (Morocco) where annual precipitation is between 300 and 400 mm. While cultivation practices may vary, it is recommended to include Jawahir in a conservation agriculture (zero\/ minimum till) system. Crop management includes machine seeding in November at a rate of 200 kg per hectare corresponding to approximately 300 plants per square meter. Fertilizer application consists of manually applying 200 kg of NPK (15:20:15) in November and 100 kg of urea in February. Herbicide application of 1 litre is suggested in February. Harvesting takes place in June using a combine harvester, and during July and August, the stubble is left for grazing. Following this crop management system, the costs per hectare are estimated to be around 2610 Moroccan Dirham (about 261 USD) per hectare.\nThe direct gross income from Jawahir, based on grain yield, is approximately 1,120 USD per hectare, based on a yield of 3,200 kilograms and a selling price of 35 USD per 100 kilograms. The additional gross income from straw yield is around 1,100 USD per hectare, assuming a yield of 5,500 kilograms and a price of 20 USD per 100 kilograms. This results in a total direct gross income of 2,220 USD per hectare.\nHowever, if processed into couscous for human consumption, Jawahir\u0027s higher semolina yield (i.e. more kilograms of semolina per kilogram of grain milled) and better semolina color means an extra gross income of 4,560 USD per hectare. Additionally, when the straw is used for animal fattening, the extra output per hectare is around 900 kilograms of lamb meat (based on a conversion rate of 6 kilograms of feed to 1 kilogram of meat). Then the total extra gross income from production of meat is 5,500 USD per hectare.\nIncluding both direct and indirect income, Jawahir provides a total gross income of approximately 12,280 USD per hectare from grain, straw, couscous, and animal fattening.\nIn conclusion, enhanced crop varieties like Jawahir offer increased resilience to the challenges posed by climate change in dry areas. These varieties provide benefits such as cost savings, disease and pest resistance, and improved yields. By adopting these varieties, farmers can enhance their agricultural productivity and mitigate the impacts of climate change on their livelihoods.\nAcknowledgement: ICARDA\u2019s work on breeding is supported by the Accelerated Breeding Initiative of the CGIAR and The Crop Trust.

The technology described covers one such response in Switzerland.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Seraina LerfIn response to changing environmental conditions, it can be valuable to adopt new plant varieties that offer benefits such as drought tolerance. The key is the improved adaptation of the crops to heat and drought. These adaptations are based on plant physiological and morphological characteristics that confer increased drought tolerance, as well as phenology, which can also affect the plants\u0027 water requirements. The goal is to reduce production losses and promote a regional, plant-based food system in Switzerland. To introduce and maintain drought-resistant crops requires specific activities and inputs, such as selecting suitable seeds and ensuring long-term profitable cultivation. This technology is applied to cropland in Switzerland, especially in the Swiss Plateau, where climate change is causing increasingly warmer and drier summers, as well as more intense precipitation in the winter months. These climatic changes favour the cultivation of crops that can better cope with drought periods, allowing for the replacement of crops that require irrigation in the same growing areas.\nThe main purpose is to adapt agricultural production to the effects of climate change while simultaneously reducing the emissions caused by farming. By cultivating drought-resistant crops, the risk of production losses during drought periods can be minimized, and a transformation towards more diverse, plant-based, and regional food production systems can be promoted. A major advantage of this technology lies in the adaptability of the selected crops to climate change. Since they are better adapted to tolerating drought periods, no additional irrigation is needed: this saves labour and other resources. Moreover, growing drought tolerant crops enables the production of regional, plant-based, and protein-rich foods (especially legumes) that are appreciated by certain consumer groups and can be better marketed.\nHowever, there are also challenges and disadvantages that are not yet appreciated by land users. The lack of knowledge about non-traditional crops in Switzerland is a significant problem. Both theoretical knowledge and practical experience in cultivation are lacking, leading to high risk for farmers who must experiment with cultivation. Additionally, despite climate scenarios predicting drier summers, there is still the risk of cool and wet summers with increased precipitation. Besides the biophysical challenges, there are also socio-economic obstacles, as the demand from wholesalers is often focused on traditional crops, and niche crops like millet are commonly not popular.\nThis documentation focuses on an example of an innovative farmer in Spins, Switzerland. Stefan Brunner has been testing a wide variety of drought-resistant legumes such as lentils, lupins and black runner beans on his Eichhof farm since 2017. In addition to the large-scale cultivation of these drought-resistant crops, he also cultivates quinoa, peanuts, chia, sorghum, millet and rice in a demonstration plot. Stefan Brunner simultaneously attaches great importance to sustainable cultivation methods which include surface tillage and mulching.COMMENTS:The regions in which the technology is used are located in the agricultural zone of SwitzerlandSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biologicals|Biotechnologies|Genetic engineering and gene editing (CRISPR, etc.)|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)|Social and socio-economic","type_id":"993, 2100, 994, 995, 1196, 1203, 1199, 1076","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improved plant varieties|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|Alternative food production|production of alternative protein sources (e.g. insect farming, meat substitutes)|climate change mitigation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 918, 902, 910, 914, 909, 920, 921, 934, 937, 919","readiness_level":"7.

The productivity of rainfed pastures in Uzbekistan is highly depend on weather conditions and varies sharply over years and seasons (from 1.5-2.0 to 5 centner \/ ha). Inefficient use of pastures, poor use of measures to restore degraded areas caused a significant increase in anthropogenic pressure on pastures, which contributed to their degradation. Cultivation of desert fodder plants on rainfed lands, such as Kochia prostrata, Halothamus subaphylla, Ceratoides ewersmanniana, Atriplex undulata, which are most adapted to soil and air drought, will create additional feed reserves, reduce the stocking level and ensure balanced nutrition of animals.

This practice involves overnight confinement of the animals which are individually tethered with ropes and stakes.\nTo effectively deploy this technology, oxen are restrained from late afternoon to early morning in a field, during the dry season, to utilize their manure directly as organic fertilizer. The entire heard is transferred from one plot to another or within the same plot, at varying intervals, ranging from a few days to a maximum of two weeks, to distribute the manure. This grazing technique is the preferred method employed during the dry season for fertilizing cereal fields by farmers who have livestock or can borrow animals. For farmers, the advantage of this grazing approach lies in the fact that the animals themselves transfer the fertilizer with minimal investment (ropes, stakes, etc.). All animal droppings, including faeces and urine, are deposited on the land during the 14 hours they typically spend there during  a day. In these conditions, the quantities of faeces deposited amount to approximately 50 kg of dry matter per Tropical Livestock Unit (TLU) per month.  With faeces and urine emissions evenly distributed over several hours, animals\u0027 droppings are dispersed over the grazing land depending on the amount of time they spend there, the rest being concentrated in resting areas, night paddocks and watering places (streams).\nGrazing takes place between January and April. The animals are removed from the fields as soon as the first rains fall, to start preparing the soil for planting crops.\nFarmers without animals of their own request livestock from other farmers, offering to feed them in exchange for their use during the grazing period. To ensure the animals are adequately fed during this period, some farmers plant Gliricidia trees on their farms. These fast-growing leguminous fodder trees not only serve as a source of food for the animals but also contribute to stabilizing and restoring the soil through nitrogen fixation.COMMENTS:These cultivated areas serve as post-harvest grazing grounds for animals. The study area boasts the highest concentration of livestock farmers in Benin. Unfortunately, the potential inherent in this livestock has not been fully harnessed. The introduction of GIZ\u0027s ProSOL program brought about increased awareness among farmers regarding the advantages of coexisting with livestock breeders. Consequently, negotiations ensued between farmers and breeders, resulting in agreements for the latter\u0027s animals to graze on the farmers\u0027 farmland.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation|Low-cost farming tools and techniques","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1198, 1197, 1206, 1076, 1088, 1089","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 916, 921, 922, 910, 914, 909, 918","readiness_level":"7.

Previously, the slash and burn agriculture was a main livelihood activity of local land users in mountainous areas and they had no experience regarding the cultivation of lowland rice. This, in fact, affected food insecurity among the local communities with limited arable land whilst population growth and increasing land pressure in the hill area. As a result, a Project supported by Oxfarm Australia that has been working in Ta Oy District since 1996 with the aim to reduce encroachment of isolated areas in natural forests. The Project e.g. has established the Natural Disaster Management Committee at village level. The project played an important role in providing options regarding permanent livelihood activities for local communities. Dry season rice cultivation along banks of streams was one of the potential alternatives for livelihood improvement particularly to ensure food security and to reduce the workload. At the beginning, the Project provided training to the local land users on how to use buffalos for ploughing as they never used this approach before. The Project also provided rice seedlings, agricultural tools (hoes and shovels) for the land preparation. During the first phase of the Project, there were only few households interested to participate as they were afraid that it would impose negative impacts on local culture and tradition. This because the land users believed that rice cultivation has only to grow in higher land areas and rice stems should not be soaked in water. Nevertheless, there were a number of households who decided to participate in the trial phase of the Project anyway. The Project encouraged them to contribute labour for the whole rice paddy development process and mainly also to support the excavation needed for the land preparation along the streams. Areas suitable to this technology should be on relatively flat land at similar level to the stream which allows simplified access to water. Usually, the land users start land preparation on December to January during the dry season. Before dry season, the land gets flooded every year and in consequence brings fertile deposits to the soils. Later, many land users expressed their interest to implement dry season rice cultivation on the river banks. As a result, village residents have expanded rice paddies wherever suitable. These terrains include stream areas very near to the village. Finally the land users got very happy to have own their paddies so near to the village. Inappropriate beliefs have been gradually eradicated prior to cultivate now lowland rice. Actually, households have more rice for household consumption although\nit may be insufficient for all year round. This means that many land users still need to cultivate additional areas in the uplands due to limited land in the lowlands. But the general purposes of reducing significantly the swidden agriculture in the uplands and also to decrease labour for these activities has been achieved anyway. In addition, the land users could benefit from increased animal fodder in the form of rice straw during dry season and the rice straw for soil cover in the vegetable gardens to retain soil moisture. Moreover, people from neighbouring villages also learnt from this initiative and implemented it in their villages too.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation|Grassroots innovation networks|Low-cost farming tools and techniques|Institutional|Capacity development function|Farmer field schools|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1076, 1088, 1090, 1089, 1116, 1126, 1125, 1196, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|disaster management|income increase|Access to knowledge and advisory|agricultural skills development|access to agricultural advice","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 910, 1154, 1180, 965, 968, 967","readiness_level":"7.

Stones are carefully positioned in a specific pattern to create a stable, durable wall. They either follow contour lines or are laid out approximately  perpendicular to the slope. Some common features and elements of dry stone walls include the following:\n- the stones used to build the wall are of varying sizes and shapes, with larger stones placed at the bottom and smaller stones on top;\n- the wall is built on a foundation of large stones or rocks buried in the ground;\n- stones are carefully selected and placed to fit tightly together, ensuring stability and preventing soil erosion;\n- the wall can be straight or curved, depending on the terrain and the wall\u0027s purpose.\nThese walls are commonly found in rural areas with annual rainfall exceeding 400 mm, on stony soils with medium to steep slopes and deep soils. Dry stone walls are an effective way of reducing soil erosion and improving water management in hilly and mountainous areas, creating terraces with beds that facilitate farming.\nThe installation and maintenance of dry stone walls require skilled labour and specialized knowledge.\nThe steps involved in erecting a drystone wall are as follows:\n- site preparation: the area must be cleared of all vegetation and debris;\n- foundation preparation: the foundation should be 30 cm to 1 m wide and slightly sloped inwards to ensure stability;\n- wall construction: with larger stones at the bottom and smaller stones at the top, the stones are tightly stacked together;\n- drainage: to prevent water from accumulating behind the wall and causing damage, drainage channels must be created in the wall.\nThis technology removes stones from plots, holds soil in place, prevents erosion, preserves soil fertility, enhances biodiversity, creates jobs and supports local economies.\nFarmers generally appreciate these advantages of dry stone walls. However, some may find them difficult to build and maintain, and may prefer other types of water and soil conservation structures. In addition, the use of dry-stone walls is limited by the availability of suitable stones and skilled labour in certain regions.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|Farm management|income increase|field management","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 921, 920, 922, 918, 910, 1180, 914","readiness_level":"9.

But there were no alternatives for the land users of that patch about the optimum utilisation recharged water. The surrounding area was totally unbunded with sandy loam soil. Therefore, land users are of opinion to go fo field bunding. Earlier the practice was to dig a trench at upper gadient \u0026amp; put a bund below it out of the excavated soil from trench. But the requirement of land users was to get some water in each farmers land to protect the Kharif \u0026amp; some early rabi crop.(june-dec).

The technology area is located near the main drainage line, therefore, the sub-surface water availability is more \u0026amp; can be utilised for cultivation of crop even in dry spell of the year. Earlier the farmers near to this place tried to dig a small well \u0026amp; could irrigate for only 2-3 months of the year to get some subsistence crops. Therefore, water availability throughout the year is a first priority of the farmers. At the outset, a livelihood focused micro-plan had been prepared by the villagers stating the details of the base-line data along with problems \u0026amp; alternative solutions. The patch was identified to be the worst affected \u0026amp; the owners of the land are poor people (defined by villagers). Usually the land users used to migrate in search of labour due to loss in the agriculture. It is because the water availability is not there at the time of requirement. The people of this patch are ready to contribute at least 10% of the cost as the structure is to be constructed in government land. In the mean time the project sent the PIA to Water technology centre for eastern region, Bhubneswar to study the linking of water harvesting structure \u0026amp; dug-out well \u0026amp; its relevance in this context of our situation. The technology was done in the village Chareimara which is one out of 3 villages of one watershed, located at the lower reach of the watershed. In the meantime many water harvesting structures \u0026amp; field bunds were constructed due to which the water could be stored in the recharge zone. This area is again a mix of stony patches in the crop land. One water harvesting structure was constructed just at the upper reaches. The surrounding area was totally unbunded with clay loam soil. Therefore, land users are of opinion to go for a deeper dug well which can feed water through out to at least 15 acre of land. The requirement of land users was to get some water in each farmers land to protect the Kharif \u0026amp; rabi crop including summer vegetables. A four-day in field training was conducted by the project to community link workers (SWC), particularly on patch treatment, use of levelling instruments like A-frame, proper planning, design, lay-out of different type of structure in a map \u0026amp; ground.  At the same time there was a blind belief that large water harvesting structures are more useful to farmers. So the land users demanded for a large WHS on the drainage bed which requires huge investment \u0026amp; high maintenance cost. But when some farmers of that watershed could get good result by digging well these land users also started thinking about a \u0022community dug-well\u0022.

This area typically floods for more than 9 months, is perennially wet, and is covered by Hogla (Typha), Reed plant, and weeds. Crop cultivation has been difficult due to unfavourable drainage conditions. Local people previously cultivated paddy only in small areas by clearing the swamp vegetation. Now, however, some of the marshy land has been converted to a dyke and ditch multi-cropping system, which has been practiced for the last 200 years. Through this practice, the marshlands have provided valuable harvests for generations and currently yield vegetables, fruits, timber and fishes for farmers and that support local livelihoods. The marshland ecosystem, that converted to terrestrial ecosystem now support habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna. The technology reduces the pressure on arable land through construction of dykes which also plays a crucial role in flood mitigation. The continuous series of dykes and ditches with diverse vegetation increases the aesthetic beauty of the region and conserve biodiversity as well.\nThe dykes are elevated beds of soil constructed to 4-6 feet height and 12-14 feet width. The dykes are constructed with soils collected from ditches and on the top of the bed water hyacinth composed are used. Along with increasing fertility, water hyacinth compost also increases the soil holding capacity of the dykes. Though water hyacinth is normally one of the most dangerous invasive species, it can be converted to useful resource by this system. The ditches are 10-11 feet wide canals and deep enough for fish culture. According to size of land owned by farmer the length of each dyke and ditch varies. All the ditches are interconnected with a regular flow of water. Once the dyke preparation is complete, crops including brinjal (eggplant), turnip, red amaranth, coriander, spinach, cowpea, chili, cornflower, tomato, papaya are planted. On the bed, 1 foot wide drain is constructed after every 3 feet intervals. Creepers and vines are planted on sticks along the sides of the dyke to prevent erosion. Trellis crops like bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ash gourd, sweet gourd, cucumber, etc. are cultivated in between two dykes and over the ditches. Guava, Hog plum, banana, lemon, pineapples and other fruit trees planted are in the bed after three years of establishment. Timber trees are also introduced in the dykes over time though some beds are only managed for crop cultivation. Through this way, they establish a multi-crop and agro-forestry system. In the ditches, farmers cultivate local fish varieties that generate extra income for them. Water hyacinth also managed in the ditch that used as fertilizer in the bed. Farmer add soil to the dyke from the ditches once in every year to raise the dyke and make it stable. The local community also developed a large floating market of guava, which now attracts tourism in this area and facilitates alternate income.\nThe initial investment of establishing dyke and ditch technology is expensive due to huge labour requirement for dyke preparation and often difficult for farmers to manage the required money. Usually they take loans from neighbours or micro credit organizations with high interest to initiate the work. Almost 80% of the households are involved with micro credits in Swarupkathi because loans from the national bank is much more time-consuming. If the farmers can get easier access to loan and marketing facilities from the government, they will benefit more from the dyke and ditch system.COMMENTS:As closest cropping system agroforestry is selected. The crop composition is seasonal vegetables followed by horticulture crops.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Traditional and indigenous practices|Conservation practices|Species diversification|Integrated management systems","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204, 1206, 1198, 1200, 1197","use_cases":"Production|crop production|fisheries products management|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 900, 910, 1180, 916, 917, 918","readiness_level":"9.

It was established by Grimme from Germany. With this new technology small holes and micro-dams are built in the furrows between the potato hills. They are intended to improve water infiltration and to help retain water near the plants, while preventing waterlogging and stagnant water in depressions and minimizing surface runoff and soil erosion.\nOn conventionally farmed potato fields (where an all-in-one potato planter can be used) no additional working steps are necessary and the Dyker can be used simultaneously with the potato planting machine. This saves time and money. For other crops or if no all-in-one potato planter is used, the Dyker can also be attached to a tractor as an individual trailer (without potato planter). Then one ore more additional working steps are needed after plantation.\nThe system is intended to prevent soil erosion and waterlogging during the cultivation process of potatoes. Furrows running parallel to the gradient are mostly endangered by soil erosion during the first 4-8 weeks until soil cover reaches a certain percentage. Small holes and micro-dams in the furrows increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff and thereby prevent soil erosion and water logging.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): The major land use problem is soil erosion by water occuring mainly at hillside situations.

Main activities are pruning and selective weeding. Managing such a system requires a profound knowledge of locally adapted crops and the local vegeation, and also of plant growth dynamics. There is no general recipe as a dynamic agroforestry system looks different in each place, but there are universal agroecological principles such as the natural succession stages and biodiversity. Dynamic agroforestry is like other agroforestry systems useful to implement an efficient land-use system which does not necessarily degrade soils, water sources and biodiversity, while producing different goods (food, feed, construction material, medicines....) at different times of the year. Dynamic agroforestry have the specialty that the pioneer plants produce already in the first year (e.g. rice or corn), so that a hunger gap can be avoided until the main crop (e.g. cocoa) starts producing after several years. There is a long history of capacity building, field trials and farmers own experiments in different ecoregions of Bolivia. Farmer-to-farmer trainings have been used as well as NGO-led projects to install plots on farmers\u0027 lands. In Bolivia, different groups of farmers and NGOs started to use dynamic agroforestry after courses by Ernst G\u00f6tsch from Brazil in Alto Beni in Bolivia with cocoa agroforestry systems in the 1990s. From there the knowledge spread constantly through different people experimenting, mainla in the sub-humid lowlands of the Amazon Basin, but also in semi-arid regions around Cochabamba. Today there are many exchanging events with interested farmers and experts fom other countries, and a larger dynamic agroforestry project in Cote D\u0027Ivoire. There is also an annual international one-week course on dynamic agroforestry taking place in Bolivia led by the NGO Ecotop. NGO founders from different parts of the world who have long been living in Bolivia and manage agroforestry farms themselves have been playing an important role in advancing the approach by organizing courses and events, some scientists have conducted research on soil fertility, yields, pests and diseases, and many farmers have long-standing experience from experiments with dynamic agroforestry on their land.COMMENTS:Implemented by \u0022lighthouse\u0022 farmers, and participants of projectsSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Native species utilization|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1196, 1201, 1200, 1206, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|forestry management|Access to knowledge and advisory|agricultural skills development","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 921, 918, 919, 927, 965, 968","readiness_level":"8.

These dams are used for both controlled and free submersion.\nThe side of the embankment is about one metre higher than that of the side spillway. When the water level reaches the height of the side spillway, water flows down through the structure and continues along the riverbed on its normal route downstream. In-season rice growing is carried out both upstream and downstream of the dam. Upstream growers farming areas peripheral to the reservoir are advised to use varieties of floating rice or those that can withstand prolonged flooding. The seedlings for this kind of rice must be sown before the reservoir fills with water.\nAt the end of the growing season, the water is retained in the reservoir for watering animals and for fishing. Market gardening activities are carried out along the entire length of the river, with water being extracted from dug wells (sumps two to six metres deep).\nIn Mali, there are around 15 schemes in place in the circles of Sikasso, Kadiolo, Bougouni and Yanfolila, covering more than 1,000 hectares and benefiting 1,500 rural families. In these areas, more than 60% of rice growers are women. More than 100,000 head of cattle are watered each year from the reservoirs. The very large quantity of stored water considerably increases the potential to use land for vegetable and tree growing.\nLocal people formulate the requirement and negotiate with the commune on the investment programme; they identify the rules of access and set up the farming cooperatives and management bodies. The commune plans investments and assumes overall control of the construction work, delegates management to users, and validates the farming rules and oversees their correct application. Consultancies carry out the socio-economic, environmental and technical studies (scheme design, plans, models), draw up the invitation to tender document and support the tender selection process, and monitor and inspect works. Technical services oversee the application of technical and environmental standards and participate in ensuring sound financial practices (collection, financial control, public service concessions). Contractors carry out the construction work. The project team provides training (planning, social engineering, studies involving farmers, etc.), advisory support (organisation of users, formulation and validation of rules, area development plan, plan to develop and exploit value chains, selection of suitable crop varieties, management delegation procedures, procedures for securing land titles, etc.) and co-financing.\nThe users are divided up into management and maintenance teams and their respective responsibilities are clearly defined prior to the interim and final acceptance of works.\nThis type of scheme is effective in areas with good rainfall levels and in lowland areas where the water table is not very low. It is important to select lowland areas with the potential to store a substantial volume of water (topographic basins). This type of scheme works best in southern areas of Mali with 1,100 to 1,200 millimetres of precipitation per year.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 10 km2.\nIn the Sikasso region; in 15 or so communes within the circles of Kadiolo, Sikasso, Bougouni and Yanfolila.

Keeping these grazing lands productive and healthy demands good management, and getting the right balance between stock numbers and the forage resource is a considerable challenge.\nLand in good condition has a healthy coverage of so-called \u20183P grasses\u2019: native perennial, productive and palatable grasses, important to cattle and to the health of the landscape. Less palatable plants include annual grasses, native and exotic forbs and shrubs. The heterogeneity of the pasture resource results in uneven utilisation, and thus overgrazing in parts.\nIn order to prevent pastures in good condition from degrading, or to restore\/improve deteriorated pastures, utilisation needs to be adjusted according to climate and the state of the \u20183P grasses\u2019. In practice, the only means of manipulating pasture composition over large areas are grazing, resting from grazing, and burning.\nThe flexible Ecograze system includes wet season resting, and is based on the establishment of three paddocks with two herds within a rotational system. The key is that all paddocks get some wet season rest two years out of three. Wet season rests are divided into two phases: (1) The early wet season rest starts after the first rains in November\/December and continues for 6-8 weeks, it is particularly good for perennial grass recovery; (2) the late wet season rest lasts until March\/April and aids both seed set and vegetative recovery.\nAverage paddocks of around 3,000 ha in size are sub-divided into three relatively equal sizes, though some flexibility is required to balance variation in the productive capacity of different land types within the paddock. The paddocks are fenced and extra water points through polythene piping and additional water troughs, and where required, pumps are established. The return on investment can be realised within a few years.\nThe main management challenges are: (1) the timing and length of the early wet season rest, which depends on how effectively the early rains promote vegetative growth of perennial grasses, and (2) the movement of animals during the wet season. The number of stock movements are fixed - but the timing is flexible and should be responsive to the situation: the challenge is to learn to assess the pasture condition, read the situation, and schedule the timing and length of the rest period accordingly. The main criterion is the recovery state of perennial grasses.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 10 m2.\nstudy terminated after 8 years (2000-2001).\nThe paddocks of an average size of around 30 km2 are subdivided into three paddocks of an average size of 10 km2. The technology is therefore documented on one of the subdivided paddocks. The 10 km2 is the area per subdivided paddock, each farm (localities) has 10 km2 (respectively 3*10km2) area, where the technology is applied.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Over the last 20 years there has been a decline in the condition of grazing lands in north-east Australia. The evidence is a decline of palatable, perennial, productive grasses (\u20183P grasses\u2019), reduced ground cover and an increase in sediment and nutrient movement into streams. As a consequence of economic pressures and over-optimistic expectations of good rains, stocking rates have often been too high.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): same as above (combined)\nRanching: YesSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 910, 914, 916, 917, 918, 921, 909","readiness_level":"7.

However, other ecosystem services, such as pollination and cultural services, may simultaneously be enhanced by using the same measures. One such measure, which is popular and effective in temperate countries where agro-environmental schemes are implemented, is the planting of flower strips as habitats.\nIn intensively managed tropical rice production systems, biological pest control, pollination services and landscape aesthetics could also benefit from the establishment of flower strips on the bunds within irrigated fields. The specific aim of the technology featured here is to increase biodiversity in rice fields and provide habitats for beneficial organisms such as predators of rice pests (e.g. spiders) or parasitoids (e.g. hymenopteran parasites), which in turn will help to minimize the use of pesticides. An additional benefit is landscape beautification.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The process comprises collecting seeds of flowering plants (e.g. flowering annuals such as Melampodium divaricatum) and planting them in a nursery. After a month or so they can be transplanted into rice fields on bunds, with a strip size of 0.25 x 5 metres, and a distance between strips of 5 metres (to enable access for farm operations such as fertilizer application). Farmers are requested not to spray insecticides when they test this system. The flowering plants should be pruned during the fallow period in the wet season; and they will require watering during the dry season when rice is cropped. The flower strips will need to be replanted after the rice crop is harvested, if an annual species are chosen.\nNatural \/ human environment: While this SLM technology is for an irrigated rice ecosystem in the center of the island of Luzon in the Philippines, it has already been applied in other rice producing areas \u2013 for example in Vietnam and, with some adaptations, should be applicable to irrigated lowland rice production systems throughout Southeast Asia.COMMENTS:Major cash crop: vegetables\nMajor food crop: rice\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): pest outbreaks; low population of natural enemies; loss of biodiversity and health hazards to farmers.

Also genetically modified organisms and materials are not used. Green manure or low quantities of organic fertilizers, preferably from dung (sheep, goat, cow, chicken), are used to increase and maintain soil fertility. Green manure is provided by seeding a mixture of leguminous nitrogen-fixing species and cereals in autumn (October) and incorporating this into the soil with tillage in springtime (May). To optimize the fertilizer effect, there is still scientific discussion on the need for mowing the green manure and letting it dry for several days before it is ploughed into the soil. For this system, no ploughing is performed in winter, which reduces fuel use and emission of greenhouse gases. In addition to its fertilising effect, green manure provides a continuous surface cover during winter time protecting the soil from erosion. The products grown under this ecological system command a higher market price than those grown under conventional production schemes.\nPurpose of the Technology: The aim of ecological agriculture is to protect biodiversity and the environment and maintain or improve soil fertility and reduce soil, water, and air pollution. Under ecological agriculture and by using green manure, soil cover, soil organic matter, and soil biological activity will increase, which positively affects soil structure, soil fertility and soil water infiltration capacity. This reduces the sensitivity of the soil to surface crusting and it reduces surface runoff and soil erosion by up to 60%. Workload and energy use are up to 50% lower than under conventional agriculture, and benefits may increase around 40% due to higher yields. Moreover, a higher market price of ecologically produced almonds and olives will lead to increased farm income. This better economic return discourages land abandonment of marginal lands with low productivities under conventional farming. Ecological almonds and olives production does not require special establishment activities or investments in specialized equipment.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Infestations by, for example, insects and caterpillars are treated twice yearly by degradable products based on copper salts (Oxicloruro, max 3\u2030 solution) and mineral oils in winter, or  the spores and proteins produced by the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis or based on natural pyrethrins (from the Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium; max 1.5 l\/ha) in springtime. In ecological agriculture, farmers are obliged to take advice and instructions regarding plague control and fertilizer use from technicians specialized in ecological agriculture.\nNatural \/ human environment: Soils mostly have a shallow to medium depth (between 20-60 cm), and slopes are gentle to moderate (between 5 and 15%). The climate is semi-arid with a mean annual rainfall around 300 mm. Droughts, in summer, commonly last for more than 4-5 months. Annual potential evapotranspiration rates larger than 1000 mm are common. The production system is highly mechanised and market-oriented but depends strongly on agricultural subsidies. All cropland is privately owned.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): A lack of water availability seriously limits the production potential of the soil and results in a low vegetation\/crop cover.

Water availability is an issue. The perennial Ewaso Ngiro South river flows through the Shompole swamp, a vital drought refuge for livestock and wildlife, before ending up in Lake Natron. The area, roughly 1000 km2, is covered by two group ranches, Olkiramatian and Shompole, which are managed as a single ecological unit. A group ranch is a jointly owned freehold land title given to the customary occupants of communal lands. The total number of occupants of both ranches number roughly 20,000 people, with the majority belonging to the Maasai ethnic group. The ranches have not been subdivided and are not fully sedentary, unlike many other areas of southern Kenya.\nThere is a long history of co-existence of wildlife and livestock in Maasialand. In Olkiramatian and Shompole seasonal livestock movements and herding practices are formalized by group ranch grazing plans governed by local committees. The wet season grazing areas are termed \u201clivestock rearing zones\u201d. The dry season grazing areas have been retained as \u201cgrass banks\u201d for livestock, and since the early 2000s, have been used additionally as wildlife conservancies for ecotourism (see figure below). Livestock rearing occurs to the east of the Ewaso Ngiro river; grass banks and the wildlife conservancy to the west. Grazing committees from both group ranches manage livestock access to certain areas, with the conservancy (grass bank) rested during the wet season of up to six months. When grazing is permitted in the conservancy, as the dry season progresses, temporary settlements are limited to an area called the \u201cbuffer zone\u201d. Livestock must then move into the conservancy from the buffer zones to access this late season grazing. The \u201clivestock rearing zone\u201d is permanently settled and grazed year-round. Within each zone there are small \u201cOlopololis\u201d (grass banks of a few hectares), situated near individual settlements and used to maintain higher quality pasture for weak and young animals. This management strategy ensures that the dry season grazing area is rested during the rains, and it helps to maintain consistently higher biomass and taller grass than that of the wet season grazing area. The higher biomass also corresponds to a rainfall gradient running from the Nguruman Escarpment edge in the western extremity of the group ranches to the dry central rift valley floor in the east. The biomass in the dry season area is used by both livestock and wildlife grazers during the late dry season and in droughts. The grass bank is only grazed out during prolonged dry periods. The Maasai employ a strategy of using the shorter milk-producing grasses of the livestock areas during the rains and the coarser grasses in the grass banks for the dry seasons. The shorter wet season pastures have a higher nutrient content and greater digestibility than the grass bank: this is very important for lactating females. The grass is kept short from both grazing by livestock during the growing seasons and due to intrinsic differences caused by shallower soils and lower rainfall in these grazing areas.\nWithin this broader governance framework and control of grazing areas, individual decision making is also permitted within these controlled areas. This allows herders to manage livestock to improve production in relation to each herd. For example, individuals might split the herd to take advantage of different energy and nutrient requirements of lactating females, bulls, and calves.\nThis maintenance and exploitation of forage heterogeneity is vital to the productivity and resilience of the landscape, and this heterogeneity exists at multiple scales, with the major differences existing between the grazing areas, but also smaller difference within them. Resource heterogeneity facilitates wildlife-livestock coexistence. This heterogeneity creates a matrix of varying quality and quantity of forage. Wildlife species have different metabolic requirements and diets, and this varied base ensures that a diverse wild ungulate population is maintained year-round. Late season forage boosts the resilience of wildlife during extreme events. This technology requires a governance structure that is both responsive to the changing ecological conditions and able to build consensus and enforce grazing management.COMMENTS:The technology formerly worked across the entirety of Maasailand (50,000 km2). However, breakdowns in social structures, culture, and governance arrangements have led to wide-scale losses in traditional grazing management. Olkiramtian and its neighbor Shompole, are two of the few communities managing to graze in such a way to maintain and capitalize on the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of forage resources through merging traditional and modern institutions.Number of growing seasons per year: 2\nLong rains fall between April - June; Short rains fall between October - December.\nLivestock density: Cattle 6.2 \/ km2; Shoats 52.2 \/ km2SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Institutional|Governance function|Inclusive decision-making processes in agriculture|Social and socio-economic","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1206, 1116, 1129, 1131, 1076","use_cases":"Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|livestock monitoring|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 1186, 899, 916, 917, 918, 920, 921, 910, 914, 905, 909","readiness_level":"7.

In case the farmer plants trees like lemon trees as long-term crop it can further be declared as agroforestry system. One important reason why farmers grow both, long-term and short-term crops on the same plot is to optimize the use of land resources. Another reason is that the short-term crops offer the opportunity to generate income to the farmers long before the long-term crop is productive.  \nThese were also among the main reasons why Mr. Sokhom Oem from Svay sa village, Khnach romeas commune, Bavel district, Battambang province (the north-western province of Cambodia). He changed from mono-cropping to the intercropping system in 2016. His farm is connected to very deep alluvial soils (pH=5) with high topsoil organic matter and medium soil texture. The average annual rainfall in the region is 1100 mm. On a flat plot of 325.5 square meters (18.3 x 45 meters), he planted 10 lines of lemon trees (4 lemon trees per line). The space between each lemon tree is 4.5 x 4.5 meters. On his first year in December, after plowing and drying the soil, he planted eggplants at a distance of 80 to 100 cm on 40 rows between the lemon trees (16 plants per row = 640 plants). The reason why many farmers potentially prefer eggplants as an intercrop is that it can be grown as a yearlong crop that provides an initial fruit harvest only after one month of planting. After first harvest they continue to bear fruit during the whole year long. A fact that is very appreciated by the farmer, as this kind of plant does not require lots of work. Nevertheless, the productivity of the intercropped eggplant depends on its maintenance. Old leaves need to be removed when the plant has few flowers (General Directorate of Agriculture, 2012). After the eggplant cultivation the farmer can change to other intercrop vegetable if he likes. Lemon trees, on the other hand, can take up to three years before they produce fruit for harvest, after which they can be harvested continuously during 8 to 10 years.  Sometimes trees can provide fruit during the whole year, but their productivity depends on sufficient water supply during the period from flowering to harvest.  All in all, while waiting for full lemon yield the eggplants are an early and secure source of income. A further advantage to be mentioned is that eggplants improve the soil cover that protects from weed growing and in consequence eases the land management.  \nBesides the optimal use of the land, this technology also maintains and improves soil quality through the use of toilet residues. Only well decomposed liquid toilet waste (without a strong smell) is used in the form of a mixture of urine and feces which is drained from the septic tank. The application of this organic waste is based on the application of between 300-400 mm per lemon tree, after which normal watering is practiced. This liquid toilet waste is applied again when an intercrop like eggplants are producing less harvestable fruit. The intercrop plant residues are also kept as soil cover between the lemon trees, to provide more organic instead of using chemical fertilizer. The intercrop residues also help maintain the soil moisture content.  \nAt some time after the initial adoption of this intercropping technology including the use of organic residues, land users understand the need for maintenance rather than anticipating ongoing long-term benefits after the immediate benefits. For example, the watering of the intercropped eggplants and of the lemon trees needs to be maintained in order to maintain their productivity. It is noted that farmers are able to achieve better and more sustainable incomes from the intercropping when compared with their previous practice of single cropping with corn or in the case of this study site sugar cane.COMMENTS:Main products\/ services: Eggplants and lemon trees\nHe will rotate to other crops after eggplants between lemon trees.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|income increase|optimization of resource use for better production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 1180, 909, 915, 916, 921, 912","readiness_level":"7.

More than 80% of the land in the intervention area can be classified as \u0027Char\u0027 and is inhabited by 60% of the population served by the project. Every year, especially during floods, the rivers deposit huge amount of silt sediment that makes the land fertile. At the same time, river action washes away some portion of the \u0027Char\u0027 which at times can be quite large and has a strong impact on people\u0027s lives and livelihoods. Before the intervention, people living on \u0027Char\u0027 land depended on their traditional early warning mechanisms and were frequently surprised by floods that destroyed their crops and put their lives in danger. Due to recurring floods, people didn\u2019t have the means to improve their built environment. The \u0027Char\u0027 land is furthermore characterised by its lack of public infrastructure and remoteness to public services.\nThe technology consists of setting up an emergency infrastructure and ensuring community access to these infrastructures during times of floods. It has to be understood in close interrelation with the approach of setting up an early warning system. The emergency infrastructure includes specific flood shelters (for people and animals), flood-proof collective water sources and sanitation systems, transport infrastructure such as foot bridges and elevated rural roads, as well as flood-proof health and school facilities that also serve as emergency shelters during floods. The flood shelters are built on a raised bed of soil and located at sites selected by the communities that are relatively better protected from flood and river erosion within the \u0027Chars\u0027. The purpose of the technology is to ensure safety of life and protection of assets during times of emergency and also to mitigate sufferings related to floods. The flood shelter is an elevated plane land which is on an average 220 square feet by size and at least five feet high from the existing ground level. The site is selected by the community and should be connected through an elevated road to the nearest community. This arrangement helps people to get easy access during times of floods. The shelter has collective hygienic latrine facilities and safe water sources. People generally dismantle their housing while evacuating and reinstall it on the flood shelter.\nThe major activities include facilitating the development of community-led risk reduction action plans and their implementation through community participation and engagement of local governance institutions. This includes maintenance of the built infrastructure as the joint responsibility of the community and the local government. Land use, especially sowing and harvesting, is increasingly linked to flood related forecasting measures which has led to significant adaptation in the timing of farming activities. This coupled with the creation and access to emergency infrastructure allows for a relatively safe and healthy living. The adopted technology and approach has led to adapted livelihoods, reduced health costs and increased income.  The technology has furthermore led to mainstreaming disaster risk management in policies and approach of local government institutions. Increasingly the local government\u2019s cash and food for work programmes are targeting establishment and\/or reinforcement of emergency infrastructure that can cater to larger population. Increased investments are made especially towards flood shelters and improving communication and access to emergency infrastructure. Since the technology is based on local knowledge and has been developed in consultation with the involved communities, it is generally well accepted with a fair degree of ownership and involvement. However, parts of the region are also prone to river erosion and this has a destructive impact on built infrastructures. The technology does not assure any safeguard against this form of uncertain river action.COMMENTS:Since the disaster resilient infrastructure set up by the project is installed at a huge number of sites (as indicated in the description above), only a sample of the various emergency infrastructures are indicated on the map above  (If needed a comprehensive GPS reading of all infrastructure built by the project can be provided separately).\nThough emergency infrastructures are built at specific sites, their use and benefits are evenly spread over an expanded area.Despite the lack of public infrastructure and services and being exposed to natural hazards people tend to prefer to live in the \u0027Char\u0027 as it brings significant economic benefits for them: crops grow rapidly and abundantly with significantly lower input costs than on the mainland.\nCow, buffalo, goat, lamb and donkey are very common in the area. People rear these for cultivation, transportation and for having meat. Every household have at least a pair or more of livestock.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Digital technologies|Geospatial technologies|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Institutional|Governance function|Knowledge management function|Partnerships|Policy|Experimental and Adaptive Policy Mechanisms|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1188, 1015, 1052, 1196, 1204, 1116, 1129, 1123, 1135, 1095, 1096, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Farm management|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|income increase|Production|animal production|crop production","use_cases_id":"910, 1154, 916, 918, 912, 1180, 897, 899, 898","readiness_level":"7.

As a low cost fuel source, local households often use cow-dung and wood. Taking these from the local area contributes to decreased soil fertility and erosion processes. Most of the dung collected from livestock is burnt in a very inefficient manner for cooking, baking and heating purposes. Based upon assessments by Welthungerhilfe in 600 households (HH) who were using cow dung as the only fuel material, on average one HH uses 4.6 tons of cow dung annually when using traditional cooking stoves, 6 tons for heating and 4.5 tons for bread baking. This means almost 15.1 tons of cow dung is burnt annually per HH. \nUsing a simple modification of the traditional cooking stove, approximately 50 - 60% or 2.3 tons of fuel material can be saved. This saving can be further increased by the utilisation of a pressure cooker that decreases the cooking time by 50%. Not all local hot meals can be cooked with a pressure cooker but it can contribute to an additional saving of 0.7 ton of organic matter. \nThe introduction of a metal heat exchanger on the exhaust pipe of a cast iron stove can help save a household 3 tons of fuel material per year, the effectiveness can be further increased by the incorporation of bread baking compartment.\nFurther savings can be made by using straw, mud and wood to improve the thermal insulation of the exterior walls, ceiling and floor in the house.\nThrough the integration of all above measures approx 60% of the current usage rates of organic material used for fuel can be saved. In addition it will keep the house warmer for longer, reduce the smoke in the air, and help retain organic material in the soil.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main objective of the energy efficiency technology is to address one of the root causes of the deforestation process and to improve soil fertility i.e. to decrease the demand from the local population for organic fuel. This project used a range of technologies to address this issue which in combination provided substantial savings in organic fuel.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Cooking stoves: For centuries local populations have been using traditional cooking stoves for cooking, especially during the warm seasons of the year. These were made from a mixture of mud and straw. The modification of these involves improving the aeration process during the burning of the fuel. This is achieved by putting a metallic cover with one inflow cutting and six small smoke outflow holes surrounding the cooking pot. The only input needed which is not locally available is the metallic cover.\nPressure cookers: As maintenance is required 1-2 times per season to keep the cooking stove functioning efficiently, the utilisation of pressure cookers can be easily integrated with the modified cooking stoves.\nHeat exchangers: The heat exchangers installed on top of the iron ovens, can be produced by local tradesmen and need to be cleaned every 1-2 months. They have to be installed before the start of the winter season when the heating is needed.\nHouse installation: The house insulation, using locally available materials does not need maintenance once it is installed.  However, the storage of dry fruits or bread in the attic should be avoided as it could attract mice which can destroy the insulation.\nWelhungerhilfe provided subsidies for all the above work, except for the heat exchangers.\nNatural \/ human environment: The geographical area served by the project is mainly hill slopes, covered in low grade pasture fodder with wheat crops planted in loess soil. Although the soils have the potential to be very fertile, they are overused and not well managed and thus have become degraded and denuded. One of the main contributing factors to this is the removal of organic material from the biomass cycle. Trees, bushes and organic material is cut and collected to be used as fuel.\nThe main source of income in the area is from semi-subsistence farming, and the removal of organic material has a significant impact on their crops and livestock.\nThe houses are made from concrete foundations and mud bricks, these and the current stoves are all energy inefficient and fail to retain heat.COMMENTS:Several energy efficiency measures were implemented by households in three neighbouring districts; Baljuvon, Temurmalik and Khovaling.

As such, the technology known as \u201cenergy-saving ground stove or energy-efficient ground stove\u201d is being promoted in the region. This technology ensures that (i) smoke is eliminated in the kitchen, thus achieving a healthy environment, (ii) cooking is done faster while the stove retains beat for longer periods, (iii) up to 60% of firewood used with traditional cooking stoves is saved, and (iv) accidents from open fires are prevented.The energy-saving ground stove is constructed by digging a hole inside the kitchen or in the compound. For domestic food preparation, the hole is usually 1 square meter and 15 cm deep. The end where firewood is inserted is about 20 cm wide; while the opposite end where the fire burns is about 30 cm wide. Sometimes, the ground hole is lined with a layer of clay on the floor and walls. During construction, the common wind direction should be noted, especially when the hole is constructed outside the house. Constructing this ground hole does not require much technical skill although making a good one requires some experience. A hand hoe is commonly used for digging the hole, but any ground excavating tool can be used. This technology helps to preserve heat in the soil for further cooking; thus reducing household demand for firewood considerably. Ultimately, this reduces the pressure on deforestation. It also substantially saves women farmers\u2019 precious time, otherwise spent looking for firewood. This technology is particularly important for people who use firewood for cooking, because most energy- saving stoves available in the markets are expensive and require charcoal. Other locally made portable stoves also require charcoal. The challenge with the ground-stove technology is that it is not portable, hence, cannot be moved from one point to another. When constructed outside the kitchen, it becomes filled with water during rainy season, a factor that constrains its sustained use.COMMENTS:cooking points or kitchenApplied at cooking points or inside kitchen.SOURCES:\n","type":"Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"1076, 1088","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change mitigation|Production|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"916, 925, 927, 917, 919, 897, 909","readiness_level":"7.

The approach is highly relevant for livestock farms, as more than 80% of Uzbekistan\u2019s pastures are located in desert zones, characterized by a very hot, dry climate and low precipitation. Desert ephemeral vegetation completes its growth cycle within a very short, moist spring period.\nIn addition to harsh natural conditions, pastures are subject to excessive stocking rates, overgrazing, and the absence of pasture rotation, all of which accelerate degradation. Due to unfavorable natural and climatic factors, disturbed vegetation cover recovers very slowly through natural regeneration. Meanwhile, the growth of livestock production requires increasing pasture productivity to secure adequate forage resources. This technology offers an effective method for natural pasture improvement.\nThe method involves sowing seeds of various local drought-resistant plant species (such as \u0027Haloxylon persicum\u0027, \u0027Salsola arbuscula\u0027, \u0027Calligonum\u0027 spp., and others) in 10-meter-wide strips alternating with strips of natural pasture of equal width. On the plowed strips, seedlings are planted in furrows spaced 1-m apart, with seeds additionally sown in the same furrows to ensure reliable germination. Over time, shrubs and subshrubs expand into the interstrip areas, while natural vegetation reestablishes on the plowed strips. This results in the formation of a complete agro-phytocoenosis: grasses + subshrubs + shrubs.\nThe technology is inexpensive - approximately USD 100\u2013150 per ha, and yields positive results within 3\u20134 years. Farmers can later expand and enrich pastures by distributing seeds without incurring additional costs. The established plantations allow for year-round grazing.\nKey stakeholders in pasture phytomelioration include farmers, agricultural clusters, forestry enterprises, rural citizen assemblies, farmers\u2019 associations, agricultural and land management departments and environmental protection agencies.\nIt is recommended to carry out sowing of desert plants during the wet season (December\u2013February), taking into account weather forecasts. Sowing may be done using seed drills or manually. To improve germination, seeds are mixed with manure and dry sand in a 1:5 ratio.

Special attention was paid to environmental impact assessment to harmonize economic and social development with environmental protection. All communities included afforestation of severely eroded land,  re-establishing degraded forest belts and planting new forest lines, creating protection shields for aquatic areas, and elaborating and implementing a ecological education community program.\nThe first action implemented was agricultural land re-parcelling, based on FAO guidelines. Training programs were conducted for project staff and beneficiaries. Following land planning, discussions and individual negotiations with each land owner, the project promoted the application of the following land parcels operations: sale, exchange and long term lease. The costs incurred during land transactions were fully covered by the project. The Land Use Scheme implies changes in some categories of use and especially expanding the area of vineyards and orchards as well as using agricultural land for community development according to the needs and wishes of the population. Land re-parcelling offers farmers the possibility of rearranging agricultural land according to ecological principles and potential.\nThe overall goal of land re-parcelling component was to respond to the concerns of the Government and others about the fragmentation of agricultural land: it focussed on small peasant farms as its primary target group. The specific objectives of the pilot action were:\n- to test the demand for and feasibility of land re-parcelling with small landowners as the primary target group;\n- to facilitate development of 6 community area development plans, taking into account environmental impact assessment.\n- to use the pilot experience as the basis for designing a potential national-level approach, including techniques, resource requirements and legislative framework;\n- to assess the impact of re-parcelling at the local level, including on land markets, agricultural production, and equity. \nThe re-parcelling activities were extended to 40 villages on the proviso that the concept and the experience of the implemented re-parcelling pilots would be precisely followed. Based on this experience, the Ministry of Agriculture is in active partnership with National Agency for Rural Development and NGO BIOS, supported by the FAO-developed National Strategy for Land Consolidation.COMMENTS:The six communes which form the pilot area, namely Basauca village Rezina district, Sadova village Calarasi district, Calmatui village Hincesti district, Bolduresti community of Cantemir district, Baimaclia community Cantemir district, Opaci village Causeni district, Republic of Moldova.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Institutional|Governance function|Policy|Social and socio-economic|Social contracts","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1116, 1129, 1095, 1076, 1137","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|Governance, policy support and intelligence|impact assessment to evaluate project outcomes|climate change adaptation|Farm management|income increase","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 921, 980, 983, 918, 910, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

It has invaded over 13 million hectares, which is around 4% of the total land area of the country. In the context of Madhya Pradesh, the species has encroached on shared and remote villages\u2019 lands along the fringes of protected areas such as the Kanha Tiger Reserve, impacting wildlife and local communities in multiple ways. \nTribals in the Kanha landscape generally inhabit upper catchments of rivers, usually having large portions of uplands as part of their landholdings. These lands have never attracted investments from land development projects. They used to cultivate millets (particularly Kodo and Kutki) every alternate year. Apart from this crop, the farmers collect tendu leaves (Diospyros Melanoxylon) from these lands every year. Keeping the soil quality in view, they take these crops every alternate year and in some cases, once in three years with a gap of two years. This gap of two years helps Lantana spread on private land. \nTraditional practices for controlling lantana camara are chopping the main stem, clipping aerial shoots, burning, and grubbing (total uprooting). These practices however, either led to vigorous regeneration of Lantana or were labor intensive. The cut rootstock method\/technology applied under the project provides minimum disturbance to the soil, wherein the plants\u2019 roots are cut three inches below the ground. It is followed by lifting the bush and keeping it upside down to prevent it from gaining ground.\nThe Foundation for Ecological Security (FES), an NGO located in India, has been working on the eradication of Lantana Camara from the commons land since 2010-11, however from the year 2016-17 onwards, with the support from GIZ, FES also started supporting village institution in eradicating Lantana from private upland. Significant activities are undertaken for the eradication of Lantana and as shown hereunder:\nA. Improving community governance mechanism; local communities were engaged by ensuring that the village executive committee took the Gram Sabha (Village Governing Body) into confidence and prepared the by-laws to conserve the lantana-eradicated site. Rules and regulations were framed for the uprooting of the Lantana, its payment process, and usages of the uprooted Lantana for fencing the plot, preparation of biochar, or other usages providing ecological benefits. \nB. Adoption of the \u2018cut rootstock method\u2019 for the uprooting of Lantana; removing Lantana is tricky because methods such as burning, haphazard uprooting, or cutting result in the recurrence of the species. \nC. Appropriate measures were taken to minimize the recurrence of Lantana seeds through regular monitoring and plantation of grass seeds and other plants. \nD. Grass seed sowing; with the active support of the village institution, the collection of indigenous grass species was done. Before the advent of the monsoon, the community prepared the grass seed ball and sowed it in the plot. A seed ball helps the seed to protect it from insects, birds, and runoff. In the rainy season, these grass seeds germinate and grow. With the grasses coming, the lantana seeds do not get a suitable environment to germinate and grow. \nEradication of Lantana from the private lands helps the communities access their lands. This has resulted in the cultivation of millets on the same land, which was otherwise left fallow for so many years.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Production|crop production|improving soil management practices|forestry management","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 897, 898, 921, 927","readiness_level":"7.

This site is located close to the settlement Kasristskali. It is community pastureland, which was abandoned and not maintained for many years. The site had been dominated by thistles and weeds before the intervention took place and was not suitable for grazing. 30% of the area was previously used to store manure and is rich in nutrients. To reclaim the pastureland for cattle, an area of 6.1 ha was mowed twice and equipped with an electric fence (two lines of electric wire and a solar-powered energizer brand Voss). This was done to regenerate the area so that a grazing regime could be introduced later. An electric fence was chosen because wood is not available in the area and a wire mesh fence would be more expensive. Furthermore, an electric fence is flexibly adjustable, which is essential for a rotational grazing system. It is important to remove the residues after the mowing to reduce the amount of weed seed. The time of mowing should be before the flowering of the most common weed species. An ongoing mowing and grazing regime was set up to favour fodder plants instead of weeds: Since the cows only eat the fodder plants and leave the weeds standing, the weeds have a clear advantage. To counteract this, the weeds are mowed, and fodder plants are sown.   Mowing is needed for the first 2 years and after that, it is enough to control the quality of pastureland by a grazing system. For maintenance purposes, the area was cut once in early spring and a second time in summer. The evaluation in September, after the pastureland was recultivated, showed that the northern and eastern parts now have a grass and herb cover suitable for grazing, while the central, western and southern parts are still overgrown by weeds. This is due to the fact that these parts were very rich in nutrients from the very beginning and consisted exclusively of thistles.  In order to improve the productivity of the site, it is recommended to cut the vegetation again in autumn, remove the residues, open the soil with a harrow and sow a pasture seed mixture adapted to the climatic conditions in February. \nThe local community farmers were involved in all activities. They were participated in development of local pasture management plan. The plan was approved by the community members and they are ready to follow the applied methodology and  maintain the pastureland after the project completion. The farmers acknowledged the benefit from the proposed methodology and they invested to rehabilitate the additional area (6 ha) of pastureland with their own financial sources. \nThe 6.1 ha plot which was restored as pastureland with this technology is planned to be used as a paddock for alternating grazing between free-range and the paddock.COMMENTS:The national park Vashlovani is nearby.The main income of the village comes from agriculture in the plains of Shiraki Valley and livestock breeding in the hilly land east of the plains.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Animal management machinery|Vehicles and machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1195, 1194","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 910, 914, 916, 921, 917, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

These species are found across both dry and wet areas, which means that the technology can be applied in several agroclimatic zones.\nGrassed strips are biological barriers that control runoff and mitigate soil erosion on gently sloping land, while simultaneously providing farmers with fodder for livestock.\nWhere there is no natural, maintained strip, grass is planted along contour lines by direct sowing or transplanting. The number of rows per strip varies from 1 to 4. The strip must be fairly dense, with no gaps along its entire length. The spacing between two strips varies from 25 to 40 meters, depending on the slope and type of terrain. The main activities involved in creating grass strips are as follows:\nChoosing the grass to be used:\nThe grass must have a root system strong enough to survive the dry season. It must also grow easily and quickly. For the purposes of this documentation, the grass used is Andropogon gayanus.\nLayout:\nStrips should be laid out perpendicular to the direction of runoff, following the contour lines.\nPreparatory activities:\n\u2022Harvest Andropogon seeds in the dry season;\n\u2022Mix the seeds with damp sand for 12 to 24 hours;\n\u2022Stir the mixture to remove seed hairs.\nInstallation of grass strips:\n\u2022Determine contour lines on the ground and trace them with a pointed object (pickaxe, plough) so that you can locate them when planting.\n\u2022 In July, sow the seeds in at least two rows, after preparing the soil (it is advisable to minimize ploughing), at the start of the rainy season at a rate of 6 kg\/ha of seed.

The Chokar watershed is a mountainous area situated between 600 - 2,500 m above sea level. The climate is semi-arid with harsh and cold weather in winter and hot and dry summers. The annual precipitation in average years is 580mm. Land degradation affects all forms of land use and includes low vegetation cover, heavy top soil erosion from water, and poor soil fertility. Unsustainable agricultural practices, over-exploitation and high pressure on the natural resources are adversely impacting on the socio-economic well-being of local communities as well as contributing to the risk for being adversely affected by drought as well as landslides and flash foods triggered by heavy rainfall. The data used for the documentation of the technology is based on field research conducted in Chokar watershed, namely in the villages: Sari Joy, Jawaz Khana and Dashti Mirzai. These villages represent the upper, the middle and the lower zone of Chokar watershed, respectively. They differ considerably in access to services and infrastructure, but in general are poorly served. The communities depend on land resources for sustaining their livelihoods. In a good year with high yields, wheat-self-sufficiency lasts about 5 months. The three villages are home to ethnic Qarluq communities. Since 2012 the Livelihood Improvement Project Takhar (LIPT) implemented by Terre des hommes (Tdh) Switzerland has initiated a range of NRM interventions.\nThe rural population in Rustaq district of Afghanistan traditionally grows local varieties of apples, pears and grapes. Mostly it is subsistence farming with a small-scale local marketing.  Shortage of irrigation water and lack of specific knowledge about horticultural and viticulture practices, negatively affects fruit yields. Apart of providing diverse fruits for consumption, orchards are also important for providing fodder for the livestock, retaining soil moisture and protecting the soil from erosion.  \nThe local land users interested in the establishment of improved orchards and vineyards  were mobilized through the Natural Resources Management Committees (NRMC) in Sari Joy, Jawaz Khana and Dashti Mirzai villages. In addition to the local varieties of pears, apples and grapes, new improved varieties were used for orchards and vineyards on 6.5 ha of degraded land. Such orchards were established inside or close to the villages on mountain slopes with gentle (3-5%) and moderate (6 -15%) steepness. Fruit trees are planted on locally identified dark and light soils, which correspond to moderately deep and loamy soil of medium soil fertility. Considering the medium quality of the soil, the first step of tree plantation is application of organic fertilizer. Afterwards, the plot is designed according to 4m x 4 m spacing between the trees. Under such parameters, on 1 jirib (0.2 ha) of land 125 fruit tree (apple or pear) seedlings are planted. The depth of the planting pits is 60 x 50 cm. The planted tree is watered and the lower trunk is covered with lime and water solution. Alfalfa is sown under the trees to serve as a fodder for the livestock. The orchards are irrigated mostly during summer once a week. In areas where there is shortage of irrigation water the trees are rainfed. Other maintenance activities include pest and disease control provided by a trained local specialist.  \nThe new orchards only recently started giving fruits. The actual fruit yields are expected in 2017-2018.  Expected higher yields of improved verities of pears, apples and grapes serves as a strong incentive for the local land users and their families to establish and maintain the orchards. Orchards are very demanding, but their reward is very promising in terms of improved harvest and more opportunities to sell the produce. Some land users have successful experience on their plots and already have fruits in their gardens and plan to enlarge their garden and plant more varieties of fruit trees, such as persimmons. Alfalfa which grows under the trees has important production value, particularly during the early years after the establishment phase, when the trees are too young to give fruits. \nFemale members of the households, which implemented orchards are also involved in establishing and maintaining orchards and vineyards. They take part in planting trees, watering, hay making and protecting the trees from livestock and people. Their contribution, plays an important part for the successful implementation of improved orchards and vineyards in Sari Joy, Jawaz Khana and Dashti Mirzai.COMMENTS:This documentation is based on the experiences of SLM implementers from Sari Joy (8 plots), Jawaz Khana, (6 plots), and Dashti Mirzai (3 plots). Additionally insights were gained through interviews with both  SLM implementers and observers from all three villages.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1206, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|Farm management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|income increase|Access to knowledge and advisory|access to agricultural advice|agricultural skills development|Collective action and aggregation|cooperative management to improve efficiency and governance","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 916, 918, 921, 910, 915, 1180, 965, 967, 968, 973, 974","readiness_level":"7.

The main purpose of this technology is to increase the produced palatable biomass in a grazing land in which the biomass production is very low under natural conditions.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Costas KosmasThe technology is applied on semi-arid areas of Asteroussia Mountains of Crete used as grazing land with an annual rainfall between 501-750 mm. These areas are usually highly degraded, characterized by steep mountainous slopes (31-60%). This technology was mainly found in shallow (depth: 21-50 cm), moderately fine textured soils which moderate concentrations of soil organic matter (1-3%). The stock breeders in the region use a special regime for transferring livestock grazing rights from the communities to individuals. Nowadays the off farm income of breeders is between 10-50% of their total income.\nLooking back, in the early 1950s to the 1980s the Asteroussia Mountains were a livestock-specialized area. Livestock production was based on controlled summer grazing in the mountains and overwintering in the lowlands. After the early 1960s, the area increasingly felt the impact of agricultural mechanization and - by consequence - excessive under-occupied rural labor force, which led to disproportionate out-migration from the area. In areas where limited natural capital was already fully utilized, such as in Asteroussia Mountains, further growth through increasing flocks was only possible by importing fodder. In a parallel, increasing intensification of agriculture in the nearby Messara plain limited the opportunities for the tradition of transhumance. Throughout the mid-1980s\u20132010s the economy remained livestock-dominated but the population decline continued.  However, the presence of foreign migrants offering cheap labor from the early 1990s onwards contributed to keep many farms active.\nComing back to the technology, it consists of: (a) clearing natural vegetation, usually perennial shrubs accompanied with annual plants including mainly grasses, (b) sowing of high value palatable plant species for animals such as oat, vetch, etc. during winter, (c) allowing plants to grow adequately, and (d) grazing by the animals mainly during spring for a period of about one month, and (e) keeping the land bare until next wet cultivation period starts.  The purpose is to increase the available biomass for the grazing animals in areas of low productivity of natural vegetation suitable for them. The major activities consists of clearing the land, plowing usually by a bulldoze type tractor, sowing the seeds and adding appropriate fertilizers. However, the establishment of this technology may face problems in clearing natural vegetation, if the existing Greek institutional framework does not allow doing it. Land degradation and desertification are very frequent processes in semi-arid areas and both processes have been enhanced in the last decades by climatic variations and human activities. The EU-funded research project DESIRE in Eastern and Western Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia have identified soil erosion, forest fires, and overgrazing among the most important causes of land degradation. The main benefit of this technology therefore is the increase in the amount of high quality palatable biomass for the grazing animals in degraded lands. Land users like this technology, if the number of animals is high, as without the technology they face problems of feeding them. However, such an action increases the cost of animal production such as milk. In addition, soil erosion problems are expected since land remains bare for some period of the year especially after sowing the plants.COMMENTS:Isolated fields with relatively deep soils and low slope gradientNumber of growing seasons per year: 1\nLivestock density: 20-25 animals\/haSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1203","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|income increase|optimization of resource use for better production|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 910, 914, 916, 921, 1180, 909, 918","readiness_level":"7.

A living seabuckthorn fence consists of two layers. The outer layer is an instant fence made of thorny seabu\u0441kthorn branches. The purpose of the outer layer is to immediately restrict animal and human access to the reafforestation site. The outer layer also buffers the inner layer of seabuckthorn, which is planted from seabuckthorn seedlings. The inner layer will establish itself over a number of seasons, eventually growing to a height of 1.5-2m. Once established, the seabuckthorn bush provides a low cost sustainable perimeter fence to protect reforestation activities. The bush also produces fruits for processing (in the frame of CACILM)\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of this technology is to improve heavily degraded forest areas and establish new areas by restricting open access to the human population and preventing uncontrolled livestock grazing. As part of the Joint Forestry Management approach, these reforested areas are leased to the land user providing long-term legal control, as well as income opportunities for the tenants and the State Forestry Agency.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: As part of the Joint Forestry Management approach (TAJ015), land is allocated by the State Forestry Agency to a designated land user. Once the size of the plot is established, a solid fence constructed of off-cuts of seabuckthorn and supported by willow poles is established around the perimeter of the JFM reforestation area. The seabuckthorn branches are fixed together with willow twigs, willow branches or wire and are attached to wooden poles. Once completed, seabuckthorn seedlings are planted at 0.5m intervals along a small irrigation channel on the inner side of the perimeter fence. After a few seasons these seedlings will grow into a natural living fence, which will take over the protection role from the perimeter fence constructed from off-cuts. The reforestion area is planted with branches of willow and poplar and interspersed with fruit trees. Reforestation planting materials are readily available in most parts of GBAO, and the Forestry Agency facilitates free access to seabuckthorn branches, willow branches and wooden poles. If required, wire and tools are provided by the JFM project.\nNatural \/ human environment: The natural forest cover and biological diversity in many areas of GBAO has been significantly degraded. While population density in GBAO is low, natural resources are scarce due to the high altitude mountain environment and the pressure on these resources is great.  In Soviet times, the Pamir region was highly dependent on subsidized coal from other parts of the Soviet Union. After independence, coal was no longer available and other fuel had to be sourced. Population pressure, poverty, and the lack of established local level institutions to manage forest lands have rendered forest areas an open access resource where the local population harvests forest products and grazes livestock without regulation. The local Forestry Agencies do not have the capacity to control overuse or to implement sustainable forestry management. As a part of the Joint Forestry Management approach (TAJ015) this SLM technology is a reintroduction of a traditional method for the protection of reforestation sites against livestock and, additionally, it clearly demarcates forest plot ownership and boundaries.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 20 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Open access to forests leads to illegal use and destruction of forests; grazing of livestock within forest areas hinder regeneration of forests.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Shortage of fuel wood for cooking and heating; lack of pastures and fodder for maintaining or increasing livestock herds; land degradation and increasing vulnerability to natural hazard periods\nSelective felling of (semi-) natural forests: Yes\nPlantation forestry: Yes\nProblems \/ comments regarding forest use: For now most of the forest plots are strongly degraded natural and formerly forested areas.

The technology enables determining the scale of the soil sealing threat in the province, also what is the soil quality class of the area of interest. In the municipalities with the greatest soil sealing problem and with perspective to expand in the future, there is a need for new legal regulations to force soil protection in local spatial plans. The regional spatial planning office should become a coordinator for the local spatial planning offices, to raise the knowledge about how to use soil digital maps in spatial planning, especially in the case of protecting the soil against soil sealing process. For the municipalities, large scale maps are produced, which contain results of soil sealing forecasting model.\nLand use maps of at least 10-meter resolution are produced for two historical periods through classification of the satellite images and using available local land use information. The information on land use change is superimposed on maps characterizing soil quality in order to detect to what extend the urbanization took place on valuable soils. The new sealed area, reflecting the built up sprawl of at least last 15 years, consists with expansion of the following land use classes: continuous residential area, commercial\/industrial area and transport facilities. The soils under these new land use types fully lost their environmental functions.\nIn the soil sealing forecasts the Cellular Automata-based Metronamica model is used. The software was developed and provided by the Research Institute from Knowledge Systems (RIKS) from Maastricht, The Netherlands.

Agropyron cristata is a useful pasture grass, but it is invasive and tends to dominate an area for more than 15 years. For this reason, the seeding was done in half density then usual during Soviet time (10 kg\/ha instead or more than 20 kg\/ha) to avoid the strong dominance of the fodder grass and to maintain a balance between already established steppe vegetation and fodder grass. By disc-harrowing the dry inflorescens of Artemisia were destroyed and the dominance of this species diminished. This leads to a more species-balanced vegetation, which can provide fodder and hay and reduces the risk of locust mass development.\nPurpose of the Technology: The fallow land in Kazakhstan comprises more than 10 million ha. With the climate change the agro-ecological zones will shift northwards, greatly reducing the area of the country in which cereals may be produced. As a result, more fields will be abandoned and the area of fallow land will further increase. After a few years, at most fallows a stable perennial weed stadium dominated by Artemisia lessingiana  develops, which is not well eaten by livestock and promotes the mass development of locust.\nPlowing and seeding with forage grass Agropyrum cristatum is the common method to minimize the risk of locust mass development and the production of fodder. But the seeding with A. cristatum has negative effects on soil structure and humus content and leads to a permanent vegetation strongly dominated by the forage grass and reduction of biodiversity.\nWith no-tillage cultivation and seeding in low density the biodiversity of steppe vegetation will remain and enriched with forage grass for utilization.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The cultivation was carried out in March 2010 by the farmer and his staff and his own machinery. The project provided the costs for seeds and fuel.  After 1,5 years, in September 2011 the results were evaluated by botanists, project staff and the farmer.

Soil is thrown on the upper side of the ditch to form the bund, which is often stabilised by planting a fodder grass.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Kithinji MutungaFanya juu (\u2018throw it upwards\u2019 in Kiswahili) terraces comprise embankments (bunds), which are constructed by digging ditches and heaping the soil on the upper sides to form the bunds. A small ledge or \u2018berm\u2019 is left between the ditch and the bund to prevent soil sliding back. In semi-arid areas, fanya juu terraces are normally constructed on the contour to hold rainfall where it falls, whereas in subhumid zones they are laterally graded to discharge excess runoff. Spacing is according to slope and soil depth (see technical drawing ). For example, on a 15% slope with a moderately deep soil, the spacing is 12 m between structures and the vertical interval around 1.7 m. The typical dimensions for the ditches are 0.6 m deep and 0.6 m wide. The bund has a height of 0.4 m and a base width of 0.5-1 m. Construction by hand takes around 90 days per hectare on a typical 15% slope, though labour rates increase considerably on steeper hillsides because of closer spacing of structures.\nThe purpose of the fanya juu is to prevent loss of soil and water, and thereby to improve conditions for plant growth. The bund created is usually stabilised with strips of grass, often napier (Pennisetum purpureum), or makarikari (Panicum coloratum var. makarikariensis) in the drier zones. These grasses serve a further purpose, namely as fodder for livestock. As a supportive and supplementary agroforestry measure, fruit or multipurpose trees may be planted immediately above the embankment (eg citrus or Grevillea robusta), or in the ditch below in drier areas (eg bananas or pawpaws), where runoff tends to concentrate.\nAs a consequence of water and tillage erosion, sediment accumulates behind the bund, and in this way fanya juu terraces may eventually develop into slightly forward-sloping (or even level) bench terraces. Maintenance is important: the bunds need annual building-up from below, and the grass strips require trimming to keep them dense. Fanya juu terraces are associated with hand construction, and are well suited to small-scale farms where they have been used extensively in Kenya. They first came into prominence in the 1950s, but the period of rapid spread occurred during the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of the National Soil and Water Conservation Programme. Fanya juu terraces are spreading throughout Eastern African, and further afield also.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 3000 km2.Trees\/ shrubs species: eg citrus, Grevillea robusta\nGrass species: Napier, Makarikari\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Low and erratic rainfall, soil erosion, surface sealing, water loss through runoff, low soil fertility as well as shortage of land and thus a need to conserve resources.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Low and erratic rainfall.

The trench below the embankment may or be retained. A Fanya juu terrace is often the first stage in the development of a bench terrace.\nPurpose of the Technology: They effectively reduces slope-length, and hence soil erosion from steep croplands. In some cases, enlarged embankments are made to allow ponding of harvested runoff and, therefore, the structure can be used in water harvesting systems having external catchments. The soil bund retains water and thereby, safeguards yields even during droughts. In Embu County, farmers are very innovative.

Construction is carried out after laying out pegs on the contour, or at a gradient, as required. A berm of 15cm to 30 cm is left to prevent the embankment soil up slope to form an embankment, which should be stabilized with grass. The excavated trench should be as narrow as possible to reduce wastage of cultivated land. Where the trench can be used for planting tree crops such as bananas, it should be wide enough to accommodate the crop. The embankment should be planted with perennial grass to stabilize it.\nNatural \/ human environment: Fanya juu terraces are popular in smallholder farms particularly in semi arid areas where they are quite effective in conserving moisture and nutrients. They are applicable in areas where soils are too shallow for level bench terracing and on moderately steep slopes (e.g. below 20%) They are not suitable for stony soil. They normally develop into out ward sloping bench terraces after a few years depending on the amount of soil which moves down slope and lodges above the embankment.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The technology is safe for soil erosion conservation\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): There has been a lot of erosion due to poor protective measures.

Farmers are encouraged to leave 5 stems \/ shoots per tree, cutting one stem each year and letting another grow in its place. On removing a shoot, the cut leaves are left on the surface where they reduce erosion and are then eaten by termites, returning the nutrients to the soil.

On farmland, selected trees are trimmed and pruned to manage their growth while promoting optimal growing conditions for annual crops (such as access to water and sunlight). Naturally it is a prerequisite that there should be evidence of sprouts from stumps or roots. FMNR is practiced through - but not limited to  - the following:\n1. Survey of the farm noting how many and what species of trees are present; In our project impact communities, the commonest indigenous tree species are Vitellaria paradoxa, Parkia biglobosa, Adansonia digitata, Piliostigma thonningii, Combretum spp, Diospyros mespiliformis, Lanea macrocarpa, Faidherbia albida, Acacia spp etc\n2. Select the stumps of the desired species for regeneration; and\n3. Select the best five or so stems and cull unwanted ones.\nFMNR can restore degraded farmlands, pastures and forests by increasing the quantity and quality of woody vegetation, by increasing biodiversity and by improving soil structure and fertility through leaf litter and nutrient cycling.  It has been reported in Senegal and Ghana in 2011 and 2012 that households practicing FMNR were less vulnerable to extreme weather shocks such as drought and damaging rain and windstorm. Conventional approaches to reversing desertification, such as tree planting, rarely spread beyond the project boundary once external funding is withdrawn. By comparison, FMNR is cheap, rapid, locally led and implemented. It uses local skills and resources \u2013 the poorest farmers can learn by observation and teach their neighbors. This technique is popular with land users because it is a low-cost and rapid sustainable land restoration technique. A well-established FMNR is succeeded by Farmer Managed Agroforestry (FMA) where farmers are cultivating annual crops as well are conserving indigenous tree species on the arable lands.

FMNR adapts centuries-old methods of woodland management, called coppicing and pollarding, to produce continuous tree-growth of trees from stumps or seedlings. It can be used wherever there is living tree stumps with the ability to coppice (re-sprout) or seeds in the soil that can germinate. FMNR is both a community mobilization approach for landscape restoration, and a specific technique to regenerate trees.\nFMNR depends on the existence of living tree stumps or roots in crop fields, grazing pastures, woodlands or forests. Each season bushy sprouts will emerge from the stumps\/ roots, often appearing like small shrubs. Continuous grazing by livestock, regular burning and\/ or regular harvesting for wood fuel results in these sprouts never attaining tree stature. On farmland, standard practice has been for farmers to slash these sprouts in preparation for planting crops, but with a little attention the sprouts can be turned into mature trees without jeopardizing, but in fact, enhancing crop yields (Ndour, et a., 2010; Garity et al., 2010).\nFor each stump, a decision is made as to how many stems will be chosen to grow. On average, 2-3, are recommended. The tallest and most straight stems are selected and the remaining stems culled. Best results are obtained when the farmer returns regularly to prune any unwanted new stems and side branches as they appear. Farmers can then grow other crops between and around the trees, such as maize, sorghum, sesame, beans and cowpeas. Whenever farmers want wood for any purpose, e.g. building poles, wood fuel, stakes, trellis, etc., they can cut the stem(s) they want and leave the rest to continue growing. The remaining stems will increase in size and value each year, and will continue to protect the environment. Each time a stem is harvested, a younger stem is selected to replace it (Rinauldo, 2012).\nFMNR is applicable in dry lands where it is capable of returning degraded croplands and grazing lands to productivity. It is also used to restore degraded forests, thereby reversing biodiversity loss and reducing vulnerability to climate change. Furthermore, the practice has a big role in maintaining not-yet-degraded landscapes in a productive state when combined with other sustainable land management practices such as conservation agriculture on cropland and holistic management on rangelands.\nThe farmer likes FMNR because of the direct benefits such as wood fuel, building materials, food and fodder without the need for frequent and costly replanting. Also, when FMNR trees are integrated into croplands and grazing pastures there is an increase in soil fertility and organic matter, soil moisture, leaf fodder, and crop yields. There is also a decrease in wind and heat damage, and soil erosion. FMNR is a rapid, relatively low-cost and easily replicable technology for restoring and improving agricultural, forested and pasture lands. \nFarmers dislike FMNR because the tree species, which are mainly native, grow slowly compared to other comparable species such as Eucalyptus and Pine. Native trees also grow in random locations in the landscape depending on the location of the previous trees\/seeds, making it difficult to plan arrangement of other farm activities.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|forestry management|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|income increase","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 918, 919, 921, 927, 897, 898, 910, 914, 909, 1180","readiness_level":"9.

The forest was capable of succeeding even in drought years and never slowed or lost its productivity. The trees never lost their leaves or wilt. They keep on producing flowers, fruits and seeds and are able to carry vast numbers and diversity of animal species. God put mechanisms in place which would allow the fauna, flora and soil to co-exist, with high levels of productivity, no environmental degradation, little or no erosion and a high buffering ability to withstand all the negative parameters of the harsh climate.

The case study area is situated within the catchment of river Zala in western Hungary. 37% of the total catchment area is arable land which is much lower than the national average, 27% is forest, which exceeds the national average. 15% of the land is under grassland management, 5% is horticulture, 3% is pomiculture, 2% is viticulture, 1% is reed management and fish farming. In arable land non irrigated cereals, maize and oil crops are the main farming system classes. Among permanent crops vineyard and fruit trees are the most significant.\n2. Cattle dung, urine with bedding material and fodder residues are decomposed. 4 months are needed for decomposition of the manure. After rotting the manure it is spread to the soil and incorporated. Generally winter rape, corn and sugar beet are the main crops before which manure is applied. Nitrate regulation has to be considered on fields which are defined as sensitive areas, both date and rate of fertilization are limited. Crop rotation is part of the technology, since dairy production is an important activity of the production, so fodder crops have to be produced on a territory determined by the demand of the livestock. Catch crops are rotated on the rest of the field.\n3. The purpose of the technology is to increase soil fertility. The following general nutrients are included in the farmyard manure: N%=0.3-0.5, P2O5%=0.20-0.25, K2O%=0.5-0.5 .\n4. It is important to have boving holding in a short distance to the plots of the farm where it has to be applied. The manure is spread in each third or fourth year.\n5. Impacts of the technology are increased organic matter content, improved biological activity and structure of the soil.\n6.

Though most of the area of Olancho is protected as a natural reserve or natural park, there are high levels of deforestation resulting from livestock practices and intense industrial forest management practices. However, small farmers also cause deforestation. These practices result in rampant forest fires, soil degradation and erosion. The Department of Olancho is regularly affected by tropical storms and hurricanes coming in from the Atlantic. This combination of strong natural phenomena, topographic exposure and harmful use of natural resources causes significant material damage and even human deaths.\nFascine drains are used to drain excess water from the elevated land that affects lands or houses in lower areas. This Technology is used in sites where counterslopes are present. The technology helps prevent landslides and gullies.\nFascine drains are implemented by digging fishbone shaped trenches with arms connecting to a main trench. The Technology is generally built from the bottom up and the side angles vary between 20\u00ba and 45\u00ba. The trenches are filled with live grasses, such Pennisetum sp, King Grass (Pennisetum sp) or sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum). These plants are moored with stakes that regenerate easily (such as (Madriado \u2013 Gliricidia sepium). Then, the land around the trenches is tightly packed. Since the livestock can damage the fascine bundles, the area must be fenced off. To avoid production losses, grass is sown (maralfalfa or King Grass) on top of the fascines. These grasses can be trimmed three times a year and used as fodder.\nThis technology may be combined with others, such as live hedges using Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides).\nIn this case study, the fascine drains were implemented by the Project \u201cResiliencia\u201d undertaken by the Swiss\/ Honduran Red Cross. This project aims at helping sustainable development to enhance the resilience of rural areas in Olancho by reducing disaster hazards together and promoting health at every level (home, community, municipality). Bioengineering works are implemented in areas which were identified as being vulnerable by updated risk assessments. The beneficiaries are highly vulnerable and exposed to disasters.COMMENTS:The trenches are filled with live grasses, such Pennisetum sp, King Grass (Pennisetum sp) or sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum)\nNo animals should be allowed into areas where fascine drains are built to prevent them from damaging the Technology. The vegetation (grass) is cut and taken to feed the cattle.\nHowever, the animals can freely roam the farm lands. \nNumber of growing seasons per year: 3\nThe grass is cut three times a year to provide additional fodder.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1198","use_cases":"Farm management|disaster management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|Production|animal production|forestry management|water use optimization for sustainability|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"910, 1154, 914, 916, 918, 921, 897, 899, 927, 920, 917","readiness_level":"7.

It is fast-growing, attaining maturity for timber between 12 to15 years. \nSeedlings for the eucalyptus clones are sold by various tree nursery operators in the area from where the farmers buy them. In preparation for tree planting, the land is cleared of all vegetation usually by slashing, but use of herbicides is also possible. Planting holes, measuring 30cm in diameter and depth, are dug at a spacing of 3m x 3m. Seedlings of 1-2 months age, bought from nurseries are planted in the prepared holes. Weeding is done twice a year for the first two years during which maize and beans can be intercropped with the young trees. Intercropping young trees with crops, a practice known as \u0027Taungya\u0027, helps to compensate for the weeding costs.  Eucalyptus trees are generally self-pruning but if need arises, branches that have grown larger than 6 cm in diameter are removed using a saw. Pruning becomes necessary at the age of 3 years. At planting, the number of plants is 1,100 per hectare. Thinning is usually done at the age of 4 and 7 years, leaving about 450 plants per hactare. Protecting from animals and fire and is also done periodically by patrolling and creating fire lines in the plantation. The fire lines are created by dividing the plantation into smaller units and clearing 6-m wide strips between the units.\nFarmers like the eucalyptus clones for establishing timber plantations because they grow fast and yield timber 5 to 7 years earlier than the non-hybrid species thus reducing the payback period for eucalyptus plantations. They are a source of income through the sale of poles and help in carbon sequestration which reduces the effect of climate change. \nFarmers are apprehensive of this technology because the appropriate clones are difficult to locate in the tree nurseries. Secondly, some nursery operators do not tell the truth about the performance of different clones in the area. In northern Uganda, the most adaptable clone is \u0027GC 784\u0027, which has been observed to perform exceptionally well. The cost of the hybrid clones is 40% higher than the conventional seedlings.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Biologicals|Nature-based solutions|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)","type_id":"993, 994, 2100, 1196, 1199","use_cases":"Production|forest products and logging management|improved plant varieties|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|forestry management","use_cases_id":"897, 901, 902, 910, 1180, 916, 919, 922, 914, 915, 927","readiness_level":"9.

Nevertheless, in many cases some remnant vegetation patches are still in place and can serve as seed banks during the restoration process. In order to stabilize the surface (i.e. to reduce the effects of freeze-thaw processes), to provide nutrients to the system, increase water availability and facilitate the spread of native species within the degraded areas, tractors are used to spread manure or hay over the denuded areas. All implementation is based on the methods and tools used in ecological restoration, aiming at re-activating environmental and ecological processes, and increasing the resilience of the ecosystems undergoing restoration. Denuded patches, preferably close to the remaining vegetation \u0022islands\u0022, are covered with organic matter in order to stabilize the surface, facilitate seed production and dispersal and provide safe sites for germination.\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of this technology is to halt further land degradation and facilitate natural succession within the area undergoing restoration. In the long-term, it should substantially reduce wind and water erosion. It should also lead to increased biodiversity, enhanced water availability and accelerated carbon sequestration (in the soil and vegetation). The overall restoration task is to increase the resilience of the ecosystems to natural hazards, including volcanic activity.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: In the first year, the areas are treated with a mixture of inorganic fertilizer that suits the local soil conditions, and grass seed of varieties that are proven to survive under harsh condition. A mixture of approx. 200 kg\/ha of fertilizer and around 10 kg\/ha of grass seed (usually a mixture of Poa and Festuca species) is spread over the treated area. The year after, the area is treated again, this time with fertilizer only (approx. 100-150 kg\/ha). Then the area is usually treated biannually for 4 to 6 years, based on the vegetational succession rate.\nNatural \/ human environment: In the long-term, the technology is expected to substantially increase biomass production, re-build soil qualities, accelerate carbon sequestration and secure water availability within the rangeland and the adjacent ecosystems. The areas still grazed are assumed to be more suitable for grazing and the protected areas are expected to be of better recreational and aesthetic value. The increased vegetation cover will reduce, and even halt, the sand drift that still creates challenges for inhabitants in adjacent villages, on farmsteads and within the summerhouse clusters scattered around the area. As the degraded rangeland is in the vicinity of an active volcano (Mt Hekla) the technology is also expected to increase ecosystem resilience against natural hazards like ash and pumice drift and reduce potential offsite damage caused by these materials.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 900 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Vast parts of the area are heavily degraded due to unsustainable land use through the centuries in combination to harsh climate and frequent volcanic eruptions. The major land use problem are related to the fact that the concerned ecosystems collapsed long time ago and despite all restoration efforts implemented within the area for over 100 years, the systems are still highly dysfunctional. Their carrying capacity is limited and even light livestock grazing can keep further vegetational succession down. Passive restoration might take place where the livestock grazing has been excluded but in most cases some technologies are needed to \u0022kickstart\u0022 the ecosystem and brake their negative resilience against changes.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): They are fully aware that the ecosystems are in a poor condition and restoration is needed in order to push improvements forward. They acknowledge that grazing of collapsed ecosystems can maintain the dysfunctional of the systems and hinder ecological improvements. Nevertheless, in many cases they believe the harsh climate and volcanic activities are the main contributors to land degradation - that livestock grazing and the grazing carrying capacity of the rangeland are not fundamental issues in this context.\nTypes of other land: Wastelands \/ deserts \/ glaciers \/ swamps\nTypes of other land: RecreationSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Native species utilization","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1201","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|disaster management","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 918, 919, 921, 922, 920, 910, 1154","readiness_level":"7.

The improved technology designed through community participation involves planting lines of Ficus natalensis along the contour at an interval that enables the tree to provide shade to young crops without depriving them of sunshine. When planted together with coffee trees or in banana plantations, the tall Ficus tree forms the top storey that protects the crop from the hot sun.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of  Ficus based agroforestry is to protect the soil from erosion. Within 3 to 5 years the Ficus tree forms a deep root system that stabilizes the soil. In addition, it drops leaves which quickly decay to provide both soil cover and manure thereby increasing the fertility of the soil. The trees provide firewood, fodder for livestock and bark cloth which can be used domestically or sold to supplement household income. They also act as wind breaks.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Ficus Natalensis is propagated using cuttings from young branches which are planted vertically 6 m apart along a contour. Propagation material is readily available and cheap, making the technology inexpensive to establish. Any annual or perennial crop can be inter-cropped with Ficus spp. provided the tree canopy is managed well.  The tree is quite robust and can attain heights of over 20m, with a very extensive canopy if left to grow.  Pruning raises its canopy to the desired height above the ground.  In its early stages, fencing is required to protect the tree from damage by livestock.  Within 12 to 18 months, however, the tree is established enough to withstand browsing.  Only simple tools like hoes and garden forks for digging holes\/pits are essential for establishment of the technology. The implementation of the technology on steep slopes (\u003E 50%) is not possible without other supportive SLM  interventions, in Rakai these include construction of stone lines and mulch application.\nNatural \/ human environment: The pruned branches of Ficus natalensis are used as fuel wood when dry.  Therefore scarcity of fuel wood may lead to over-harvesting of branches and destroying the canopy.  Nonetheless, the tree regenerates quickly with the coming of the rains. Ficus tree can live for a hundred years.COMMENTS:Boundary points of the Technology area: -0.96681 31.69066; -0.96706 31.69111; -0.96717 31.69033; -0.96757 31.69038; -0.96774 31.69073\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.06 km2.\nThe technology is becoming dominant in Kijonjo parish and other parts of Rakai district especially due to climatic changes that have led to shorter rainy seasons.

It comprises stones and rubble in a bund measuring 50 cm in height and 150 cm in width. The dyke contributes to sedimentation upstream, thereby reducing the slope and enhancing surface water infiltration into the soil. Tillage should be avoided to create a stable pathway for runoff water, which may also be vegetated with perennial grasses for gully\/watercourse stabilization.\nTypically, the spacing between dikes along a watercourse or gully is 20 m. The key steps involved in constructing a filtering dyke are as follows:\n* Siting:\n\u2022Determine a contour line using a water tube level;\n\u2022Mark the contour using tools like a daba, a pick, a pickaxe, IR12 cattle-drawn tine, tractor, stake, etc. ;\n\u2022Smoothen the contour line, if necessary, to reduce irregularities;\n\u2022Tie a string across the gully at the location chosen during technical identification of the site;\n\u2022Place stakes on both banks, notching them at a height of 50 cm to indicate the bund\u0027s design height.\n* Clearing the foundation trench:\n\u2022Clean the designated area on the ground;\n\u2022Open a 20 cm-deep anchoring trench along the marked-out rope, disposing of the soil downstream of the bund.\n* Design of structure with respect to water flow \n*  Laying the rubble and stones:\n\u2022Fill the excavated soil with gravel  to around 20 cm depth.\n\u2022Place large stones upstream, followed by medium-sized stones in subsequent rows, moving downstream.\n\u2022Fill any gaps;\n\u2022Lay a second layer of loose stones, with an upstream slope of 1\/1 (vertical) and a downstream slope of 1\/2, until the desired height of 50 cm is reached;\n\u2022Build the edge of the structure with large stones for stabilization, deposited in an open trench downstream.\nIn an agricultural area, this technology must be accompanied by contour ploughing (perpendicular to the slope), to reduce the risk of erosion and accelerated runoff.\nThe benefits of filtering bunds include runoff control, erosion reduction, enhanced infiltration, soil moisture conservation, groundwater recharge contribution, and increased water storage in the soil. They combat land degradation by enhancing upstream water infiltration and sedimentation of sand, clay, and organic debris. Water conservation and the retention of fertile sediments by the bunds facilitate the development of natural vegetation alongside the structures, thereby restoring biodiversity and protecting structures. Although implementation may pose challenges for landowners, they recognize its effectiveness in combating water erosion and conserving soil and water resources.COMMENTS:The technology is implemented at the scale of a micro-catchment .SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|disaster management","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 918, 921, 920, 910, 914, 1154","readiness_level":"7.

Bushfires are frequent on good-quality rangeland with over 1t\/ha of biomass.\nPurpose of the Technology: Firebreaks cut vast tracts of rangeland into smaller areas, with a view to limiting damage in the event of wildfire. They can also be established along traditional tracks. The gap in the vegetation makes it easier to put fires out along the corridor, which facilitates rapid access. When the fire reaches the firebreak, there is no combustible material to fuel it and it burns itself out.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: There are two techniques for creating firebreaks: (i) the manual method and (ii) the mechanised method. In both cases, a 10 to 15 m wide corridor is cleared perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction after the rainy season. Fires only poses a threat in the Sahel area in the dry season following a good rainy season when grass growth is good. The corridor is cleared of all herbaceous vegetation manually, using tools such as rakes, shovels and axes, or mechanically using a tractor pulling a large harrow, a four-wheel-drive vehicle pulling the blades behind it or graders. Trees are pruned, but left in place.\nThe sustainability of firebreaks depends on how well they are maintained. Once they have been created, they need to be cleared every year if grasses have grown over them again. If there is little vegetation growth, they can\nbe maintained once every two years or as required.

They are of paramount importance for protecting and securing available grazing.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Soumaila AbdoulayeIn Niger, firebreaks are constructed in pastoral and agropastoral zones, which are characterized by abundant grazing after the rainy season \u2013 but also by a high risk of bush fires. Every year, at the end of the rainy season, thousands of hectares of grazing land go up in smoke due to bush-fires. This causes enormous losses of fodder, which is essential for the survival of livestock in this Sahelian region which has lacked adequate grazing over the last decades.\nFirebreaks, as their name indicates, are strips of land set-up perpendicular to the dominant wind direction. They are between 20 and 30 m in width and spaced 3 to 4 km apart - according to the national standards in Niger. Along these strips, which can exceed 10 km in length in the pastoral zones, dried vegetation is removed. This creates firebreaks which stop the progression of fires into the large areas of grazing, thereby protecting and securing fodder supplies. In general, firebreaks are implemented according to a \u201ccash for work\u201d approach, with the aim of supporting the local economy and strengthening the resilience of the population, and of the livestock, during the lean season. Three specific objectives are set for this technology in Niger: (i) the clearance of the firebreaks is part of the annual plan for preliminary support to the populations experiencing food insecurity. These plans are implemented by the National Mechanism for the Prevention and Management of Disasters and Food Crises (DNPGCCA). This is an instrument to distribute income and food supplies to populations through the work carried out under the initiative termed \u201cHigh-Intensity Labour\u201d (HIMO), through the \u201cwork for food supplies and\/or cash\u201d approach; (ii) the selling of the straw was developed to enable people on the one hand to increase their financial resources, and on the other hand to implement strategies for storage and optimal use of the fodder resources; (iii) finally, the firebreaks provide the opportunity to ensure first, information delivery and awareness-raising amongst the local people about sustainable land management, second, the training of fire guards and livestock keepers in sustainable management of fodder resources, and third, the spatial planning of the grazing areas, with the aim of securing the movement of transhumant herds.\nThe main activity in the implementation and maintenance of the firebreaks is weeding with local tools (Hilaire, daba, machete) and the collection and storage of the cut straw. These activities require a large number of laborers (men and women). The main advantages of the technology are low implementation costs, ease of scaling-up, contribution to efficient management of the fodder resources, and a contribution to the training\/mobilization\/ organization of the pastoralist populations. Finally, it fosters efficient spatial planning of the grazing areas. The direct impacts are reduction of bushfires, improved protection of grazing areas, and an increase in the income of the local people. The indirect impacts consist of the increased financial resources of the land users, and the impacts of the measures for the prevention, and management, of disasters and food crises.\nThis technology, while combating bushfires and fostering the increase of incomes, contributes to improved livelihoods of livestock keepers and to sustainable land management. However, the systematic commercialization of the cut straw may reduce the potential for regeneration of the vegetation cover in the grazing areas, and may cause conflicts between the traders of straw and the land users.COMMENTS:The sites of the firebreaks are located in Ameidida, southwest of Abalak (40 km from Abalak).\nThe firebreaks are constructed perpendicularly to the dominant wind direction, with a spacing between the structures of 3 km to 4 km. The width of each strip is between 20 m and 30 m. The length of the strips varies depending on the length of the zone to protect. In the pastoral zone, the length can exceed 10 km. Finally, this technology is applied in pastoral areas (sylvo-pastoral or agro-sylvo-pastoral land). In the case of Ameidida, the surface covered by the firebreaks is 3 km2. The total treated area is 363 km2, including the areas between the firebreaks.Main animal species and products: In the pastoral zone of Abalak, the main animal breeds are cattle, camels, sheep, goats, mules and horses. The latter (horses) are becoming increasingly rare. Mules are mainly kept by Peulh (Bororo) and by some Tuareg.\nMain products\/ services: A small number of livestock keepers practice rainfed agriculture by producing sorghum and millet. In the lower parts of the landscape, several livestock keepers practice horticulture by producing vegetables (tomatoes, lettuce), potatoes and various fruits (mango, lemon, etc.). Over the past twenty years, irrigated agriculture has seen a spectacular development due to the implementation of adaptation strategies for climate change.\nThe pastoral zone in the region of Abalak is part of the northern pastoral zone of Tahoua, where agriculture is prohibited. But the local populations and the Hausa coming from the south increasingly produce millet, sorghum and cowpea on small surfaces. Likewise, in response to climate change, several livestock keepers have switched to horticulture, along with the development of irrigated horticulture in this region, which is oriented exclusively on pastoralism. Consequently, at the end of the years 2000, private ranches appeared, which tried to establish semi-ranching by fencing hundreds of hectares. These ranches, belonging to politicians or officers from the Nigerian army, are in breach with the regulation on pastoralism of 2010. In one of the cases, the FAO has supported this private initiative, which challenges the free access to grazing areas by the populations.\nLivestock density: The livestock numbers (in tropical livestock units) are between 200,000 and 300,000 over the five last years, which is high considering the overall area and the human population dependent on them.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1076","use_cases":"Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|Farm management|disaster management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|field management|Access to knowledge and advisory|agricultural skills development","use_cases_id":"897, 1186, 899, 910, 1154, 1180, 916, 918, 914, 965, 968","readiness_level":"9.

Greenbreaks are formed within the firebreaks by planting fire-resistant species in the gap portions such as kakawate (Gliricidia sepium), banana (Musa) abaca (Musa textilis), malunggay (Moringa oleifera), and cassava (Manihot esculenta).  As a practice, fire breaks are established in every ten hectares to form a block, but it can vary depending on the slope of the area.  Fires tend to spread quickly in higher slopes compared to flat areas, thus, more firebreaks  are recommended.\nPurpose of the Technology: Firebreaks\/greenbreaks are established to protect the forest trees and wildlings from disturbances and wildfire. In case of forest fire, firebreaks\/green breaks prevent the spread of fire from one block to another. Wildlings are seedlings derived from seeds scattered by birds, insects, animals and wind without human intervention, and allowed to grow naturally in the forest. The green breaks are planted with cash crops  as immediate source of  food and additional income for the land users.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The first step in creating fire breaks is the removal of all combustible materials such as deadwoods and cogon grasses (Imperata cylindrica) by using hoe or plow. Then, fire-resistant plant species such as kakawate (Gliricidia sepium) cuttings (i.e. 1-meter high) are staked at 1.5- meter spacing on both sides of the 10-meter wide firebreak. Kakawate is the preferred plant species because the leaves have high Nitrogen content and resistant to fire and drought.  Maintenance of firebreaks\/green breaks is done before the onset of the dry season. It is done through brushing of invasive weeds and plating of root crops.  The pruning of kakawate is done every three years.\u0022 Bayanihan\u0022 (rotational schedule of labour), a traditional communal concept of voluntary work is practiced during the establishment of the technology.\nNatural \/ human environment: The area is part of the forest reserve in Danao, Bohol primarily intended for nature conservation and protection. It is about 100-500 m.a.s.l with  moderately rolling to hilly slopes. It is under humid tropics climate with an average annual rainfall of 1500-2000 mm per year.  The soil is loam, shallow depth, low fertility, with good drainage and medium water storage capacity. The area has high biodiversity as indicated by the presence of different indigenous trees and plants species, and wild animals and birds. The land users who apply the technology are small-holder farmers.These are members of a local cooperative.  The population density is about 10-50 persons per sq. km.  Since extraction of resources from the forest is prohibited, off-farm income is very important to the land users. Access to basic services and infrastructures are low.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 3.6 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Forest fire, competition with weedy species\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): spread of invasive alien species\nOther type of forest: tree regeneration\nProblems \/ comments regarding forest use: Increase of biodiversity (Wildlife)\nForest products and services: fruits and nuts, other forest products \/ uses (honey, medical, etc.)\nNumber of growing seasons per year: 2SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Cooperative models and aggregation|Farmer producer organizations","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206, 1076, 1077, 1082","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Farm management|disaster management|income increase|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"916, 927, 917, 910, 1154, 1180, 919, 921","readiness_level":"9.

They also often serve as roads for motorised transport used to collect forest produce such as firewood and timber. The primary aim of this technology is to prevent wild fires from attacking and destroying trees, especially during the dry seasons. In northern Uganda, the technology is based on firelines of 5-6 meters width. Planted forests that use this technology in northern Uganda have an average size of 30 m by 120 m.\nThe establishment of this technology requires professional advice, starting with demarcation, using ropes or strings, and tools such as hand hoes, machetes and slashers. Maintenance of fire lines involves monitoring to ensure that the spaces are free of vegetation and dead wood. Sometimes, big trees with large canopies are maintained to discourage vegetation undergrowth\u0027s and accumulation of dead materials on forest floors.\nThe benefits derived from this SLM technology are both short and long term, including protection of valuable tree species from being affected by the fire, reduction of impact of air pollution and promotion of ecological balance. When professionally done, the value of these products can significantly offset the cost of maintaining the firebreaks in a given forest setting, especially where such fires become common. It is important to note that fire lines alone may not be a measure to prevent fire outbreaks. There could be need for community bylaws and fire fighting facilities to supplement this effort.COMMENTS:Map showing technology site in Northern UgandaSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|Farm management|disaster management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation","use_cases_id":"916, 927, 910, 1154, 917, 918, 919","readiness_level":"9.

Therefore, Oxfam encouraged the construction of communal pond to create the interest for many households to build their own ponds.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  kang phanvongsaWith the slope mountainous area, the top soil\u0027s soil nutrients and organisms are leached by heavy rain during wet season (July-November). This land was mainly used for Bong tree plantation (Nothaphoebe umbelliflora) and a variety of fruit trees; however, farmers have to wait for many years to be able to get small harvest from these trees. In 2004, an Oxfam Project promoted and encouraged local community to construct a communal mud-pond with a size of 50 x 40 m on steep terrains near the village. The project utilized the water resource potential by digging a pond for the villager\u0027s use as year round gravity fed water supply system. The project initially provided fish fingerlings (tilapia, silver barb: scientific name is Barbonymus gonionotus, and grass carp: scientific name is Ctenopharyngodon idella). The village residents realized immediately the significant benefits of the pond. Besides raising fishes in the pond, local people could use water for household gardening and as a source of drinking water for livestock (cow, water buffalo, pig, duck, etc). The pond is easy to manage and maintain whilst it is also more convenient to collect aquatic resources in proximity to the village. Typically, the potential site condition for pond construction is steep mountainous terrain with average slope of 10 -15 degrees. The soil property should be clay or silt clay which can hold the water.\nLater after the community pond has been constructed some villagers who had potential land left constructed their individual ponds to improve their own production. This because they have seen the benefit of communal pond which can provide approximately 200 - 300 kg of fish per years. The individual pond construction reduced finally also conflicts caused by different issues of the community pond.\nThe construction of the pond is not very complicated. First, the water valves from GFS (provided by the Poverty Reduction Fund) turned off the sources water from the upstream area. Bush clearing, tree felling, stump removal and vegetation stockpiling (for burning) was then required on construction areaof the pond The pond size should be designed at a size of approx. 30 x 20m. Next step, the manual excavation works (by using hoes and shovels) should ba undertaken at upper section of the canal. The ground has to be excavated with an average depth between 0.5 \u2013 1m and with the excavated soil pond dyke has to be alligned arround the pond area (square shape). The dykes soil has to be compressed to very compact barriers to prevent water leaking and dyke erosion (even small holes in dyke can rapidly enlarge, leading to the potential future damages and dyke bursting). The pond dyke\u2019s height is 1.2m in hight and 2m wide with dyke slopes from the foot to the edge (where it also provides a walkway for feeding fishes or gardening) is approximately 45%. The design of the thick dyke is to ensure its stability from soil erosion as a result from a certain fish species that pierces the dyke slopes and rapid water flow. If the pond dyke is designed with fewer slopes, it will be susceptible to soil erosion. At least a drainage outlet is required with a P100 pipe for 4m long. The pipe should be installed with 1m height from the pond bottom at the outlet. This pipe will drain water and prevent overflow that may cause damage to the dyke. The pond area later need to be leveled by using hoes and shovels cut the undulating area. Then should be kept the pond bottom dry for at least one week to allow time for pond repair as well as to increase the production of the pond bottom, after that fill the water into the pond by turn on the inlet valves that have been turn off earlier. This pond construction method may require intensive labors and extensive time to complete. Funding for construction tools and construction method are still insufficient. However, this is the effective way to maximize water from perennial stream for integrated management and its benefits are considerable especially for fish consumption in household and selling for generate household income.COMMENTS:Number of growing seasons per year: 1\nLivestock density: 2 pigs, 2 goat, 10 PoultrySOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204, 1197, 1206, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Production|fisheries products management|animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|income increase|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"897, 900, 899, 916, 920, 910, 1180, 921","readiness_level":"7.

This is done through floating seed beds which are made of water hyacinths.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Naznin ImranaFloating agriculture is a special technique to cultivate vegetables and vegetable seedlings such as Pumpkin, Bean, Brinjal, Cucumber, Tomato, Papaya, Green Chili etc. on waterlogged soils. This is done by using floating seed beds, which are made of water hyacinths and other aquatic plants such as Dulalilata (Hygroryza aristata) Tepapana (Pistia stratiotes) and Khudepana (Lemna spirodela).\nPaddy cultivation is usually done from October to April. After the paddy harvest, the lands usually remain waterlogged under 7 to 8 feet of water from May to November. With the onset of the rainy season, these regions are covered with water hyacinths and other aquatic plants etc. Normal agricultural production during this period is not possible due to this waterlogged condition and the growing water hyacinths, Dulalilata, Tepapana etc.\nHowever, floating agriculture enables farmers to use this land in the best productive way. Floating agriculture is started by collecting water plants (Hyacinth, Dulalilata, Tepapana) for preparing floating seedbeds using these plants. This is because the vegetable seeds cannot be sown traditionally into the soil. Hence, a nutritious soft ball is prepared by using Tepapana and Khudepana which is called dowla. A small amount of urea fertilizer is put into each dowla. Thereafter, different types of vegetable seeds are sown \/ placed, in wet condition, into the dowlas. The dowlas so prepared are kept in an open place for drying \/ sprouting for 3 to 7 days. Thereafter, the dowlas are placed on the floating seedbed, which have been already made, where each Dowla is placed respecting 6 inches of distance in a bed. In such manner and about 2,450 dowlas can be placed in each seedbed.  After taking proper care for one month including irrigation every day to prevent root dry up and fertilisation using a little amount urea fertilizer the sprouting seedlings are getting matured and ready for sale. \nThe establishment costs for a floating seedbed of 150 -180 feet long is between 3000 to 5500 taka. To make such a floating seedbed, a person must work 6 to 8 or 10 hours on a wage of 250 taka per workday. Nearly 25000 thousand women workers of these regions are directly or indirectly involved in this production. Each worker earns 200 to 250 taka per day. On an average, women can prepare between 1000 to 2000 dowlas per day. In this work, a female worker gets an average of 150 to 200 taka per day.  A farmer earns 6-7 thousand taka through one time use of bed by selling seedlings within 20-22 days. The seedbeds can be used at least 3 times for seedling production in a season (May to November). So, it is possible to earn 18000 -20000 taka per bed in a season.\nAfter that, the floating beds can be used again for growing vegetables, thus they are able to grow about ten thousand metric tons of vegetables annually in these regions that meets the local demand. Some vegetables are also sent to other regions \/communities, achieving a very beneficial profit. It is possible to earn about 2-3 thousand taka by selling vegetables. After completing all these seedlings and vegetables growing processes seedbeds can be sold for between 1-2 thousand taka to other farmers. Therefore, it is possible to earn 20000-250000 taka per bed in a season including all other sources of income, which are mentioned above.\nStorm and other climatic hazards cannot do much harm to this cultivation method. Besides, it is possible to produce vegetables throughout the year.\nUsing this technology allows people of waterlogged regions to turn their wheel of fortune by cultivating vegetables\/vegetable seedlings, hence being able to overcome poverty up to 70%.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 1154, 916, 918, 920, 921","readiness_level":"9.

With this technology, crops (mainly vegetables) are cultivated on floating garden beds in areas where the land inundated for more than six months in a year.\nEstablishment:\nThe basic input and main raw material to prepare the floating garden bed are water hyacinths (Eichhornia crassipes). In some cases bamboo sticks are also used to make the floating beds more resistant. The floating gardens are of different size, with a standard size per bed during preparation of 1.5 - 1.8 meter wide, 10 -11 meter long and 1 - 1.3 meter above water level. However, considering local context- such as wave action, size of water body, presence of a wetland - the bed size may vary, also depending on whether compost is added on the top. The establishment of the floating gardens are very cheap in terms of raw material and require mainly human manual labour for its establishment, without material costs for maintenance.\nThe garden can be used for two purposes: for vegetable production and for vegetable seedling production.\nIn water logged areas (where water remains for the whole year) floating beds are mainly used for vegetable production. Almost any type of vegetables can be grown in the floating bed. Production of leafy vegetables proofed to be most profitable. In addition, all types of vegetable seedlings and rice seedlings can produced in floating garden based on demand. In other areas, which are only inundated temporarily, floating garden can be used for both vegetable and seedling production. In this second case seedlings can be transfered from the garden to the fields on the main land immediately after receding of the water. This practice can save 2 to 3 weeks time of vegetable or rice production in winter season. This is a crucial advantage considering the trend to shorter growing periods due to unpredictable early spring rains.\nA key advantage of floating gardening is the fact that heavy rainfalls usually do not have any negative effect on culture of the floating gardens, which are a highly effective and beneficial risk reduction and climate change mitigation technology. Floating gardens can further contribute to food security and improved nutrition for poor households, and it is a source for additional income by making use of cheap and abundant local input resources. Different NGOs improved and promoted this technology in north-west and north-east parts of Bangladesh since 2000. Since 2011 also the public agricultural extension agencies promote this technology.\nAs an overall goal this technology aims at protecting people\u2019s assets for agricultural production from damages due to seasonal floods and provide options for alternative income resources. The floating garden technology is designed as measure to protect effectively from yearly floods. It might not be robust enough for extreme events with heavy storms and waves. Smaller repairing can be done by the owners themselves. In case of major damages the beds can be replaced by new ones, since the investment costs are very low. In the shallow areas the floating beds may become ordinary garden beds or fields during dry season.COMMENTS:More than 1000 floating beds have been prepared in 8 sub-districts of Sunamganj district in northeastern Bangladesh and documented accordingly. HELVETAS supported government agencies (District Administration and Department of Agricultural Extension-DAE) to document and promote the technology further.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change mitigation|climate change adaptation|Farm management|disaster management|income increase|field management|Supply chain management|support to consumption and nutrition|optimization of resource use for better production|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 919, 918, 910, 1154, 1180, 914, 939, 944, 909, 920","readiness_level":"9.

In order to address this issue, the construction of floating gardens were initiated by the Department of Agriculture CARAGA supported by various government agencies and Non Government Organizations (NGOs). \nThe floating garden technology and initiative, developed by the Foundation for the Development of Agusanons, Inc. (FDAI), was enhanced by the Department of Agriculture CARAGA and carried out by the Agricultural Program Coordinating Office (APCO) with the aim of establishing a sustainable agricultural system that promotes biodiversity and resilient farming practices. By using decomposed water hyacinth as a medium for growing crops, the technology helps mitigate its negative effects and transforms it into a valuable resource. Water hyacinths have a variety of negative impacts such as clogging waterways hampering boating and fishing, reducing local aquatic biodiversity and obstructing river flows which can aggravate flooding. The technlogy is being adopted by the Adaptation and Mitigation Initiative in Agriculture (AMIA) as a mitigation strategy against the impacts of climate change, enabling communities to better manage and adapt to climate-related risks. It also provides means for communities in flood-prone or coastal areas to engage in sustainable agri-fishery activities, ensuring food security and enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem health. \nThe components of the floating garden include a floater, a base (batangan), flooring (salug), growing substrate composed of layers of water hyacinth and layers of soil. Thewater hyacinths  are collected from the river, chopped, and then mixed with the soil for composting before being used as a growing substrate in the floating garden. It is applied in layers as follows: composted hyacinth\/soil mix, soil, composted hyacinth\/ soil mix, and soil. The use of water hyacinth as substrate for the compost addresses the community\u2019s concern about its proliferation, which causes obstruction in rivers, resulting in the destruction of boats and houses.\nThe standard dimension of a floating garden is 8 meters (length) by 4 meters (width), but this could be increased depending on the needs and financial capacity of the landusers. Crops planted are high-value vegetables such as pechay (pak choi), string beans, bitter gourd, tomato, bell pepper, cucumber, and eggplant, which were provided by the Department of Agriculture. \nThe FDAI played a pivotal role in project implementation, overseeing the construction of floating gardens and the provision of supplemental seedlings. The Binus-Ugan Farmers Association (BFA), as the recipient of the project, received 50 units of floating gardens through the Department of Agriculture\u0027s Adaptation and Mitigation Initiative in Agriculture (AMIA) Program. \nFloating gardens were instrumental to the community in growing crops as their source of food and nutrients during the COVID-19 pandemic, where movement from barangay to barangay was restricted. A barangay is the smallest administrative division in the Philippines. The floating gardens became a source of income as the excess produce was sold to neighbors. The floating garden initiative did not only enhance economic conditions but also attracted local avian species, locally referred to as \u0022pari-pari.\u0022 Furthermore, it strengthened women\u0027s involvement in the community, particularly through their active participation in maintaining the gardens.COMMENTS:The floating garden is within the Agusan marsh which is also considered as wildlife sanctuary.\nTalacogon and Bunawan where most of the floating gardens are located. Only the Talacogon floating gardens were visited but during the interview with project implementers, they mentioned that they have also constructed floating garden in Bunawan.Floating gardens to grow vegetables are constructed in the wetlands when the area is flooded. For the past years, flooding occurred all year round.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Traditional and indigenous practices|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204, 1206, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|Farm management|income increase|disaster management|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 918, 919, 910, 1180, 1154, 921","readiness_level":"7.

The use of such wildflower strips is increasingly being used across the world. Usually these wildflower strips are planted in bands around the edge or through the middle of a crop field. \nThis technology describes an interesting experiment that aims to see if it is more beneficial to establish several smaller flower strips between the crops to attract functional agrobiodiversity benefits to be compared to a smaller number of wider flower strips as is the standard practice.\nThe technology is being tested on 2 parcels of land that contain 2 different crops in the South-West of the Netherlands using these micro-flower strips, each approximately 0.5 meters wide, alongside access tracks running through the crops. The premise is these small strips can be effective spaces to increase the number of wild flowers present alongside a crop for the functional agrobiodiversity benefits without needing to use productive crop land. \nOverall, the technology ultimately reduces the requirement for spraying of pesticides to control problematic species, thus improving the health and production of the crops while reducing the cost and environmental impact of spraying pesticides. \nThis trial design for a well-known technology has proven to be successful if designed and implemented well. The increased locations in closer proximity to the crop supported beneficial species presence. However, how different this is compared to standard application of wildflower strip technology is still to be fully understood, especially when considering the slightly more challenging application of the trial technology design.\nThe technology trial is supported by the EU Interreg FABulous Farmers project.COMMENTS:Pieter Maris, Dinteloord\nparcel 1 Lat 51.618219 Lon 4.359685\nparcel 2 Lat 51.617056 Lon 4.347348SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Pollinator-friendly practices|Integrated management systems","type_id":"993, 1196, 1202, 1197","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|minimize pesticide use|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Production|crop production|plant health|Farm management|field management","use_cases_id":"916, 926, 917, 897, 898, 906, 910, 914","readiness_level":"7.

Growing fodder crops is a part of sustainable agriculture. The soil is protected in dry farming areas by covering the soil surface and leguminous fodder species (alfalfa, sainfoin, common vetch), which increases the soil fertility by nitrogen fixation. Applying the technology does not require extra inputs different from other agricultural crops. All that is needed is to identify a crop rotation plan including fodder production and regular agricultural crops.\nPurpose of the Technology: Different fodder crops (legumineous and gramineous plants) are produced to feed the farmers\u2019 own livestock. By enabling widespread and dense surface cover, It helps both in dry farming and irrigated areas to protect the soil from water and wind erosion.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Usually the soil is first ploughed.

The slopes in the hills, rising terraces, waste and barren land and other land types with many limitations that cannot be used for agriculture are used for fodder cultivation. In this way, the land is protected from landslide, erosion by wind and water and the loss of soil fertility due to over-compaction of soil and overgrazing is reduced. In addition, the feed quality and quantity of the livestock is improved and their productivity consequently is also increased.\nPurpose of the Technology: This technology is practiced:\n-mainly for protection of land from erosion or landslide,to protect from over-compaction and overgrazing leading to soil fertility loss  i.e. for land management\n-for the purpose of providing food for livestock even during the winter months.\n-for increasing the quality of feed for livestock and thus, improve their productivity.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: This technology involves the plantation of trees, legumes, shrubs and grasses in the wastelands and lands deemed unfit for agriculture.

It needs watering and removal of unwanted weeds for some months and the plant needs no further caring. They grow by themselves. These plants are mostly rain-fed and have no other economical or aesthetic values as such and hence, these can be used only exclusively for fodder cultivation. The tree branches, leaves, twigs, shrubs, legume plant bodies used for feed can either be cut and harvest either from time to time when required or they may also be cut and stored in fodder storages for the winter months when other sources of feed are scarce or during the planting season (Asar) when labor is scarce.\nNatural \/ human environment: We need not to create any human or artificial environment  for cultivation. The trees grow naturally and create a pleasant environment in nature. Sometimes, for crop fodder cultivation, agricultural lands may come in use. For example, in maize crop used as fodder supplement, the main plots were sown with maize varieties, and the subplots were cutting of added rows of maize after different days after sowing.

The ancient art of honey hunting, and the more recent apiculture and its products like honey, wax, propolis, bee venom and royal jelly, are examples of non-timber forest products (NTFP). A number of projects were supporting production and marketing, due to the conservation and development benefits of beekeeping. Beekeeping has low establishment costs and requires little land or labour, and by providing a suitable environment for the hives in a favourable location (i.e. forest with a range of melliferous trees and plants and sufficient water available year round) it is possible to sustainably harvest a range of bee products on an annual basis. For processing of the honey, the honeycomb is filtered and honey can be bottled and sold. Higher value is obtained by packaging and labelling. In Cameroon up to 4 US$\/kg can be achieved for good quality honey. It can also be sold for industrial use \u2013 for example bakeries, sweets. If combs are washed, the resulting honey-water can be made into wine. Wax needs to be melted and cleaned, and can then be sold \u2018raw\u2019 for a price of about 2-6 US$\/kg, or further processed into candles, soaps and creams. In Cameroon, the consumer market is expanding and a small, niche export market for high quality, certified organic and fair trade wax, honey and propolis, is emerging. The exports to Europe and the US require quality assurance schemes that entail costs, expertise and collaboration between government and beekeepers. The number of hives per bee-farmer can vary considerably from a few up to 150 hives. Approximately 15 hives can be installed per hectare. Beekeepers can be good \u2018guardians of the forests\u2019, because they know that the forest provides both forage and water for the bees, and the water and materials needed to make hives and process apiculture products.COMMENTS:Apiculture (beekeeping)\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Deforestation, Overuse of natural ressourcesSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Harvesting and processing equipment","type_id":"993, 1188, 1192","use_cases":"Production|forest products and logging management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Farm management|income increase|Access to markets|direct sale to consumers or businesses|access to price information (output)|Supply chain management|support to food processing|traceability to ensure food safety and supply chain transparency|forestry management","use_cases_id":"897, 901, 916, 917, 910, 1180, 928, 929, 930, 939, 943, 946, 927","readiness_level":"9.

These efforts are concentrated in the highly erodible Shiwalik Hills at the foot of the Himalayan range where soil erosion has ravaged the landscape, and the original forest has almost disappeared.\nThe purpose of forest catchment treatment is first to rehabilitate the forest through protection of the area by \u2018social fencing\u2019 (villagers agreeing amongst themselves to exclude livestock without using physical barriers), then construction of soil conservation measures (staggered contour trenches, check dams, graded stabilisation channels etc; see establishment activities), and \u2018enrichment planting\u2019 of trees and grasses within the existing forest stand to improve composition and cover. These species usually include trees such as Acacia catechu and Dalbergia sissoo, and fodder grasses - as well as bhabbar grass (Eulaliopsis binata), which is used for rope making. The combined measures are aimed at reestablishing the forest canopy, understorey and floor, thereby restoring the forest ecosystem together with its functions and services. Biodiversity is simultaneously enhanced.\nThe second main objective is to provide supplementary irrigation water to the village below through construction of one, or more, earth dams. The village community - organised into a Hill Resource Management Society - is the source of highly subsidised labour for forest catchment treatment. After catchment protection around the proposed dam site(s), the dam(s) and pipeline(s) are constructed. The dams are generally between 20,000 and 200,000 m3 in capacity, and the pipelines usually one kilometre or less in length.\nApart from irrigation, the villagers benefit from communal use of non-timber forest resources. Forest catchment treatment (associated with the approach termed \u2018joint forest management\u2019 - JFM) has been developed from a pilot initiative in Sukhomajri village in 1976, and has spread very widely throughout India. This description focuses on Ambala and Yamunanagar Districts in Haryana State.\nThe Shiwalik hills where the SWC technology was applied is one of the eight most degraded, rainfed agro-ecosystems of India. It is highly erodible, with presence of low water retentive soils and severe soil erosion, haing water scarcity despite average 1000 mm annual rainfall.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 198 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The Shiwalik Hills are extremely prone to both surface erosion and landslides, and general degradation of vegetation due to over-exploitation. Some areas have become completely denuded because of overgrazing and woodcutting. Furthermore there is no, or inadequate, water for irrigation of crops.\nGrazingland comments: Due to free grazing, much of the forest land was becoming barren and fodder yield declined over a period of time. The average fodder yield was about two quintals\/ha of forest land and fodder consumption was 26.69kg\/animal\/day.\nProblems \/ comments regarding forest use: Tree species like Khaci (Acacia catechu), Dalbergio sissoo in pits and slips of bhabbar grass (Eulaliopsis binata) on mounds of trenches and hill slopes were planted. Bhabbar grass was sold out by forest department to contractors.\nType of grazing system comments: Due to free grazing, much of the forest land was becoming barren and fodder yield declined over a period of time.

They improve soil structure, diversify cropping systems, suppress weeds and pests, and prevent nutrient loss.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Michael StrauchIn general, cover crops are divided into summer and winter cover crops. They can be used as fodder or as a biogas substrate. However, when left in the field, cover crops support the formation of humus and serve as a source of nutrients for the following crop. Winter cover crops can be divided into winter-hardy and freeze-killed (freezing) cover crops. Choosing the appropriate cover crop depends on its purpose and its position in the crop rotation. Cover crops from the brassica\/cruciferous family should be avoided in rotations with oilseed rape (because of increased risk of pests such as clubroot, Sclerotinia or Verticillium), while buckwheat and phacelia are difficult to control in crop rotations with sugar beet. Crops that are used as main crops in a given crop rotation should not be used as cover crops.\nCompared to pure stands, mixed stands have the advantage of higher biomass production, rooting density, biodiversity, weed suppression and nutrient availability for the following main crop. Mixed seeds should include at least five types of plant species, including shallow- and deep-rooted species, varieties of freezing and hardy crops that will last over the winter, mycorrhizal species (e.g. phacelia, sunflower) and ruderal species (e.g. legumes, brassica), as well as high growing and soil shading species. Alternatively, monocrops of yellow mustard or oil radish can be grown. However, in this case, ecological benefits are not as high as with mixed stands (LfULG, 2010).\nWhere appropriate, winter cover crops should be established through direct sowing or mulch sowing. They should be sown immediately after the main crop is harvested (to make maximum use of the remaining growing season and soil moisture). However, delayed sowing (10-14 days) after harvest and stubble cultivation can be beneficial to permit the suppression of weeds and volunteer grain seedlings. Seeding density should be high enough to ensure weed suppression and sufficient biomass development, but not too high, as seed is the main cost of this technology.\nTo maximize benefits of cover crops, seedbed preparation for the following main crop should be done as late as possible, to avoid mineralization and leaching of nutrients - ideally in combination with the first tillage, for example with the application and incorporation of farm manure at the end of February.\nIn this documentation we focus on freezing winter cover crops (a mixture of phacelia, buckwheat and sunflower) sown in August\/September before the following spring crop (maize). The cover crop is left in the field as ground cover for the winter. It freezes during this period. In spring, the remaining crop residues are worked into the soil by deep tillage. The farmer in our example doesn\u2019t apply this management practice for short-term economic reasons or to fulfill cross-compliance requirements - but rather for the beneficial impact on soil structure, such as reduced bulk density.COMMENTS:Freezing cover crops are planted in autumn and before the main crop silage maize (spring).SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|climate change mitigation|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 917, 922, 897, 898, 910, 914, 919, 926","readiness_level":"7.

Thus it increases food security amongst the communities.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Claudia Patricia Rend\u00f3n OcampoColombia\u0027s dry Caribbean region is vulnerable as a result of its aridity and because of the characteristics of the winds. Agoecosystems are prone to erosion and water loss. The problem intensifies in the hillside areas of the Serran\u00eda del Perij\u00e1 and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, where the slopes have gradients of more than 30%, making soil tillage difficult and arduous. In addition to this, the dry Caribbean region has high multidimensional poverty indicators and, being the Colombian territory with the greatest diversity of ethnic groups, there is poor communication with these Afro-descendants and indigenous communities. For this reason, the access of these communities to economic and innovative instruments is minimal. This problem is reflected in the high rates of chronic malnutrition in ethnic groups such as the Arhuacos and Kakuamo of the Colombian dry Caribbean (ICBF, 2015).\nIn this context, a biofortified bean (Phaseolus vulgaris var. Corpoica Rojo 39:), suited to the dry region of the Colombian Caribbean, was developed. It is agronomically adapted to the region, being rapidly maturing and drought evasive. Significantly, the biofortified beans yield an average additional 20% over local varieties. Even under local production methods, the biofortified variety produces 1000 kg\/ha, and has the advantage of better nutritional qualities.\nTherefore, the bean presents a solution to the dual problem of agronomic conditions and nutritional needs of the region. Simultaneously, being a leguminous plant, the association between its roots and microorganisms, especially bacteria of the genus Rhizobium, contributes to nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere. It also helps increase water retention and favours the development of better soil nutritional status (Tofi\u00f1o-R et al., 2016). This makes it key to the recovery of soils in arid areas such as Colombian`s dry Caribbean.\nIn addition, these biofortified beans are based on a supply chain approach: from family production to the consumer. Thus, production is sustainable, integrated into the local rural agroindustry and it benefits from short marketing cycles. The advantages include the increase in food security in communities prioritized for their precarious nutritional status.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Genetic engineering and gene editing (CRISPR, etc.)|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 994, 995, 1199, 1196, 1203, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Food quality and safety|food fortification|Supply chain management|support to consumption and nutrition|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Farm management|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 916, 921, 951, 2083, 939, 944, 918, 917, 910, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

The beans were planted using a line spacing of 10cm within a line and 30cm between lines with 2-3 seeds per hole. The selected bean varieties are high yielding and marketable. The following are the labour and input requirements for establishing this technology: a hoe, a tape measure, seedlings, 4 people and a panga.\nIntegration of beans into an already grown mango and orange field is a good and profitable practice because decomposition of the plant litter increases yields of the beans (nitrogen fixing) and the cost incurred, for example in weeding is less compared to the costs which would be incurred when the three enterprises (oranges, mangoes and beans) are planted separately on the same land.\nGenerally, benefits from implementing this technology are slightly positive ranging from improved soil fertility due to plant litter, reduced soil erosion with the fruit trees providing shade to the beans. After harvesting the beans, the farmer uses the bean waste\/ residues as mulching material for the orchard which subsequently decomposes to provide manure. Also the beans cover reduces the moisture evaporation from the soil, thus keeping the soil moist\nHowever, oranges, mangoes and beans are affected by pests and diseases and in case of this; the farmer is likely to suffer since they are planted in one field.

However, water scarcity is a limiting factor, especially in dry years. Watering through the furrow is a technological method used by farmers in conditions of limited water supply. This allows to reduce the duration of irrigation by 1.3 - 2.4 times. The water demand for irrigation and the total water consumption (evaporation and transpiration) is reduced by 20-25%. Due to the technology, the cotton bushes are short with a well-developed root system. Monitoring of soil moisture using sensors showed that  soil moisture at a depth of 40 cm in dry (not flooded) and wet (flooded) furrows is almost the same at the beginning of the second irrigation.\nConsequently, in conditions of close groundwater table, it is better to start irrigation through the furrow not from the first irrigation, but from the second irrigation. This will minimize the possible  crop damage because of the lack of soil moisture. The soil moisture equitability (and salt background) can be ensured by the rotation of irrigated and non-irrigated furrows at each subsequent irrigation. It is recommended to rotate flooded and dry furrows from watering to watering (even - 1 watering, odd - second watering, etc.).\nEsteblishment activities and costs of inputs\nActivities and contributions to the introduction \/ content: The practice of preparing the field is common, as with the farmer.

Soils are shallow and poor in productivity. The footslopes of degraded hills are traditionally used for extensive grazing or barley cultivation. However to achieve self-sufficiency in olive oil production, several farmers have developed orchards in this area - which is generally considered too dry for olives.\nTrees are spaced at 8 m apart, within and between rows. Traditionally, farmers prefer to till their orchards by tractor in order to keep them weed-free (weeds may attract sheep, lead to fires and compete for water with the olive trees). As this tillage operation is usually practised up and down the slope, the resulting furrows stimulate runoff and erosion. However, when this is combined with Vshaped and\/or fish-bone shaped microcatchments around individual trees, the furrows created can be used to harvest runoff water for improved production.\nThe V-shape earthen bunds (reinforced with some stones) are constructed manually, by hoe, around each tree. The furrows then divert runoff systematically to the microcatchments where it concentrates in basins around the trees. Each tree is effectively served by a catchment area of 60 m2. The catchment: cultivated area ratio is thus approximately 60:1 (assuming the area exploited by the tree.\nThis technology saves irrigation water during the dry season, enhances soil moisture storage, and stimulates olive tree growth. Furthermore, fine particles of eroded soil are captured in the microcatchments. While these may be nutrientrich, they also tend to seal the surface. The bunds need to be rebuilt every year. If the structures are damaged after a heavy storm, they need to be repaired. Labour input for establishment and maintenance is low, the technology is easy and cheap to maintain, and there is enough local skill to sustain and expand the system. A supporting technology is to mulch the area around each tree with locally available stones (limestone and\/or basalt) to reduce soil temperature during the summer, decrease surface evaporation and improve infiltration. The catchment areas between the trees are sometimes planted with low water-demanding winter annuals (lentils, vetch, barley, etc) especially when the trees are young. This helps to reduce surface erosion. Implementation of furrow-enhanced runoff water harvesting in olive orchards started in 2002, and adoption by farmers is growing gradually.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.05 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): There are a series of problems in this area, including: low and erratic rainfall, drought, low land productivity, poor water use efficiency, land degradation, limited ground water for irrigation, few agricultural options, and low income from agriculture.\nSemi-nomadism \/ pastoralism: before SWCSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1203, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 920, 921, 910, 914, 909, 918","readiness_level":"7.

Different fruit trees suitable for particular agroecological zones were planted in farmers\u0027 fields in twenty districts and each sapling was geocoded.\nThe main elements of geocoding fruit trees involve assigning unique geographical codes or coordinates to individual trees within an orchard, utilizing technical specifications and equipment such as handheld GPS to accurately determine the location. The potential benefits of this form of geocoding include:\n1. Location Mapping: Geocoding allows fruit trees to be accurately located on a map, providing a visual representation of their spatial distribution. This mapping can help identify patterns, clusters, and gaps in tree distribution.\n2. Data Integration: Geocoded data can be integrated with geographic information systems (GIS) and other data sources, such as climate data, soil information, and topography. This integration provides a holistic view of the factors influencing fruit tree growth and productivity.\n3. Precision: Geocoding provides precise coordinates for each fruit tree, enhancing the accuracy of data collection and analysis. This precision is crucial for making informed decisions regarding tree management and resource allocation.\n4. Monitoring and Management: Geocoded fruit tree data enables efficient monitoring of tree health, growth, and potential issues. It facilitates targeted interventions, such as irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, based on the specific needs of individual trees or clusters.\n5. Yield Estimation: By combining geocoded data with relevant environmental and growth information, it\u0027s possible to estimate the potential fruit yield in specific areas. This information aids in resource planning and harvest predictions.\n6. Disease and Pest Management: Geocoded data can help identify patterns of disease or pest infestations. Early detection through geocoded monitoring can enable prompt intervention and prevent the spread of pests or diseases.\n7. Biodiversity Analysis: Geocoding allows researchers to study the diversity of fruit tree species in different regions. This analysis can be useful for conservation efforts and understanding the ecological impact of specific tree species.\n8. Research and Analysis: Geocoded fruit tree data serves as a valuable resource for scientific research. Researchers can study the effects of climate change, urbanization, and land use changes on fruit tree populations and ecosystems.\n9. Decision-Making: Geocoded data assists farmers, agricultural agencies, and policymakers in making informed decisions about land use, tree planting initiatives, and resource allocation for sustainable agriculture.\n10. Community Engagement: Geocoded maps of fruit trees can be shared with communities, promoting awareness of local resources, fostering community engagement, and encouraging initiatives like urban orchards or community gardens.\n11. Data Visualization: Geocoded data can be visualized using maps and spatial tools, making it easier to interpret and communicate information to various stakeholders.\n12. Long-Term Tracking: Geocoded data allows for long-term tracking of changes in fruit tree populations, aiding in the assessment of the success of planting initiatives and the overall health of the environment.\nThe major activity of the technology is marking the fruit trees with the help of GPS so that these geocoordinates can be useful in tracking down the exact location of the plant. Geocoding is labour-intensive as the field workers need to be physically present in the field while carrying out the activity. Then the data recorded in GPS is transferred to the computer and analyzed using ArcGIS. This information is available to the policymakers and Agriculture officers and is shared with the Extension Agents through which it is disseminated to the land users.COMMENTS:The geocoding of fruits are in the land users field.

The seedlings are then planted at intervals of 2 m within rows and between 2.5 and 3 m between rows, resulting in a density of just over 1,000 seedlings per hectare.\nTo optimize the use of the plots where Gmelina seedlings are introduced, producers adopt the taungya system where seedlings are planted within annual crops like soybeans or maize. This approach offers the advantage of reducing initial plantation maintenance costs.\nWith respect to management procedures, weeding is conducted once or twice annually, and firebreaks are set up to mitigate the risk of bush fires. Additionally, clearing, pruning, and thinning operations are carried out.  The thinning performed by producers reduces the number of trees per hectare to 750 and 450 for the first and second thinning respectively. They do so to leave the most vigorous trees standing for the production of economically valuable timber at the final cut. The harvests consist of poles.\nThe third and fourth thinning operations, which result in the production of logs (sawn timber and\/or poles of various diameters), will take the plantation to around 250 and 150 trees per hectare respectively. It is worth noting that since the documented plantation was established, thinning has been carried out at intervals of 5 to 7 years, depending on the site\u0027s productivity index (soil production capacity).\nFor producers, the implementation of this technique generates several income-generating activities. These include both timber and non-timber products.

Combined with unsustainable land management practices, climatic stresses have exacerbated land degradation and made local livelihoods increasingly vulnerable.\nAs part of the Food Systems, Land Use and Restoration (FOLUR) project, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) designed and tested rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures to combat land degradation and enhance rural livelihoods. These RWH structures support vegetation growth, reduce surface runoff, prevent erosion, and restore soil health\u2014thereby reversing degradation and improving agricultural productivity.\nThe intervention site, covering approximately 1.6 hectares, is characterized by shallow clay soils (5\u201325 cm deep).\nGradoni orchard terraces (\u201cintermittent terraces\u201d or \u201cstep terraces\u201d) were used.  These small contour-based earth structures are separated by catchments of about 10 metres. They are designed to capture and hold rainwater, reduce erosion, and improve conditions for the cultivation \u2013 in this case of almond and pistachio.\nTwo variations were implemented depending on the slope gradient: one with stone-reinforced risers on steep slopes (20\u201325%), and the other with earth risers on moderate slopes (12\u201319%). The terraces are sited about 10 meters apart on contour lines, and the terrace beds are only 1-1.5 metres wide and the risers 0.25-0.5 metres high. Along each back-sloping terrace bed, 5 metres spacing between trees was considered optimal.\nFollowing site assessment, data collection, and detailed design calculations, implementation commenced. Although a grader was initially preferred for terrace construction, an older local tractor was used due to its better manoeuvrability on the steep terrain. The tractor ploughed the land using a two-mouldboard plough, after which manual labour, guided by technical experts, shaped the terraces. To accommodate natural contour variability, the terraces were not continuous \u2013 but gaps were left between them.\nDuring a week of implementation, 25 Gradoni terraces were constructed, of which eight were stone-reinforced. Around 340 almond and pistachio trees were planted. Two workers had spent two days marking contour lines, while ten others worked for four days to finalize the terraces after the tractor had loosened the soil. The estimated lifespan of the terraces is around 20 years without maintenance, with the stone-reinforced ones expected to last even longer.\nLand users expressed optimism about the prospect of improved incomes from almond and pistachio yields, especially considering the previously low or non-existent production due to severe land degradation and lack of water.\nMaintenance requirements are expected to be minimal. Experts highlighted the terraces\u0027 role in capturing and retaining rainwater, which supports vegetation regeneration and contributes significantly to reversing and preventing further land degradation. By improving water availability, the intervention strengthens the community\u2019s ability to withstand droughts, thereby securing income in the face of climate variability. The introduction of pistachio and almond cultivation provides a new and valuable source of income for local land users. These tree crops are well-suited to the arid environment and are inherently drought-resilient, making them an ideal choice for sustaining agricultural productivity under increasingly dry conditions.\nAcknowledgement: This SLM was introduced by ICARDA in the framework of Food Systems, Land Use and Restoration Impact Program (FOLUR) in Uzbekistan (GCP\/UZB\/010\/GFF), implemented by FAO with funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF)COMMENTS:There are ideas to include some crop production\/cultivation between the terraces.

This enables better distribution and infiltration of water into the soil. A complementing live fence, along with a metal net along the perimeter aim to stop livestock grazing. Contour ditches are planted in intervals with fruit trees, and the live fence is made of a combination of fire wood, trees and bushes. This combination makes possible the establishment of an agro forestry system on a slope in an area with limited irrigation using making use of the natural rainfall.\nDetails: 1. Ditches are dug out along the contour lines drawn by an \u0022A\u0022 frame on the slope. 2. Seedlings are planted in 5 metre intervals, positioned right in the middle of the ditch. 3. The back wall behind each tree (upslope) has a half moon cutting to enable an even water\/moisture supply. 4. The ditches are barriered with \u0022septas\u0022 between two trees to trap water in the individual sections. 5. Horizontally across the ditches, the tree species vary, but vertically are homogeneous. 6. The strips between ditches are left free to enable natural grass to grow. 7. The residual soil material is mounted in front of the ditches in piles the width of a shovel. 8. The complementing perimeter live fence and metal net (1.5m height) is supported by wooden poles made of Acacia trees. (Assumed life span of poles is 25 years). 9. Improvised drip irrigation with 5 litre plastic bottles is used together with mulch coverage beneath the trees. 10. Species composition: apple, cherry, apricot, grape, walnut, pomegranate. In the garden; species of Acacia, Ailantus, dogroses and willow act as a live fence.\nPurpose of the Technology: The aim of this system is to significantly reduce the water run-off that removes the top soil, and to subsequently prevent water erosion, and the formation\/development of gullies. This can be achieved through the following methods; conserving the available resources and using them more efficiently, prevention overgrazing and improving the natural soil cover, as well as changing the type of land management towards a more sustainable and profitable one.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The plot was established on one side of a micro watershed. In mid February the contour lines were identified using an \u201cA\u201d frame. Digging of contour ditches then took until late February. The material was accumulated down the slope in deposits the width of a shovel to build a riser. At the beginning of March all the fruit tree seedlings were planted in the middle of the ditches. Perimeter fencing was constructed and live fence plants were planted up until late March. In May, the grass around the trees was cut and used for mulching beneath the trees. During June and July in the first year the plants needed watering 3 times a week which was done using a drip irrigation system with 5 litre plastic bottles. To help prevent the water heating and evaporating, the bottles were left under the mulch cover. Mulching and irrigation are repeated every dry and hot season. Every spring, the soil material is removed alongside the inner wall of the ditch just taking an amount that equals the width of a shovel, and accumulated down the slope to extend the riser. Materials required include: (1) Ditches: hand tools, stakes, rope, \u201cA\u201d frame, (2) Live fence: seedlings of Acacia, Ailantus, willow and dog rose, (3) Fencing: metal net, wooden poles, metal wire, (4) Cow dung, lime suspension, straw, mulch, plastic bottles.\nNatural \/ human environment: The watershed can be characterised as follows: Hydrology - surface water is available only at times of rain and snow melt, this can be used for irrigation only. No sources of potable water exist. Soils are of loess type, as generally characteristic to the whole area. Flora - natural grasses prevail in the micro watershed, 9 species could be identified. Natural bushes and trees were completely removed due to high demand for fuelwood. Cultivation of rare tree varieties and household gardening was practiced in advance of the project. Fauna - Wild animals are often still seen such as turtles, lizards and snakes. Farm animals - mixed breeds of cattle, sheep and goats are very important. The households in this micro watershed area own almost 350 animals. The majority of these are kept for the summer season in adjacent pastures. The micro watershed was first inhabited in early 2000. Five households were established with a total of around 40 inhabitants. Family heads tend to be in their early 40s. Families have 7 to 9 members, including 5 to 7 children. All are of Tajik ethnicity, and Muslim, open to secular values. Of these 5 households, only 4 households have adopted the SLM technology. The fifth household only decided to join the project after witnessing their neighbour\u2019s positive experiences. Both spouses tended to be involved in the activities. Both men and women took part in the training sessions and orientation meeting. However, it is likely that most decisions were made by the men, after the women had shared their ideas. Work load: providing the external inputs, construction and the heavy manual labour were done by the men. Maintenance work: watering, mulching and grass cutting was shared between men and women. Digging and fencing were performed in \u0022hashars\u0022 - community labour groups. As women spend more time at home working within their households, they tend to perform more maintenance work on the plot compared to men. Other activities away from the farms are important to the family budget providing a means of extra income. This often includes men\u2019s long term migration to Russia to find work.COMMENTS:Boundary points of the Technology area: North -   38.284233\u00b0N  69.639420\u00b0E\nSouth -  38.278485\u00b0N  69.639555\u00b0E\nEast -  38.281854\u00b0N  69.641276\u00b0E\nSouth -  38.281250\u00b0N  69.638009\u00b0E\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.112 km2.\nThe application of the SLM technology is planned for the whole micro watershed which has a total area of 0.112 km2.

The purpose of the vegetative buffer is to intercept, and reduce the rates of surface runoff and to reduce loads of sediment, nutrients and pesticide delivered to waterways. The processes involved are filtration, sedimentation, infiltration and absorption. Reducing the input of particles and nutrients into surface waterways is desirable both to improve water quality and to prevent eutrophication of downstream water bodies. In Norway, buffer zones are primarily established to reduce surface runoff of particles and phosphorus. However, vegetation in these zones can also serve other useful functions, such as protection against bank erosion, production of biomass, and\/or provision of habitats for wildlife.\nEstablishment\/maintenance activities:\nBuffer zones are most commonly designed to retain inputs of nutrients and particles from adjacent fields. Vegetative buffers may be constructed or naturally vegetated, within or alongside fields, or adjacent to drainage ditches, streams, lakes, ponds, and wetlands. The buffer zones may consist of grass for fodder production, or be natural vegetation composed of herbs, weeds, bushes and trees. \nIn Norway, farmers receive subsidies when the area is still used for production, e.g. grass production for fodder. Farmers leave a strip in cropland for grass and herbs to grow alongside rivers, streams and lakes that intersect their cropland areas. It is recommended to sow grass when establishing grass buffer zones. Robust and dense grass types with a high uptake of nutrients are often the best suited for the purpose.  The grass strips should generally not be ploughed, fertilized or treated by herbicides, but some exceptions may be made. The degree to which the grass is harvested varies with the grass type and if it is valuable for livestock fodder.\nBuffer zones are one of the most common measures in Norway, and the requirements for the dimension of buffer zones have changed with time - and depend on the region. According to current regulations, buffer zones between the field and the watercourse have to be a minimum of 2 meters in order to qualify for production subsidies (PT-forskriften, \u00a7 4). In addition, there is a national recommendation (RMP) to maintain a minimum 6-metre wide buffer zone along all watercourses. However, regional guidelines (RMP) can differ from national ones and the width recommendation differ from county to county.\nBenefits\/impact: The effectiveness of buffer zones in retaining nutrients and soil particles has been explored by many authors. Retention capacity for phosphorus in buffer zones depends on several factors including vegetation, soil type, slope, hydrological conditions, and the width of the zone. There are large variations in the effectiveness of buffer zones: 32-91% retention of sediment, 26-100% retention of phosphorus and 0-100% retention of nitrogen. The retention effect of grass buffer zones along the Hob\u00f8l River, measured with rainfall simulation experiments under the BUFFERKLIMA project (Krzeminska et al., 2020), was: 86-94% for sediment, 86-86% for phosphorus and 78-89% for nitrogen.   \nNatural \/ human environment: The information about this Technology is based on investigations and\/or reports from different part of Norway. For the purpose of the OPTAIN project, the technology is further presented in the natural and human environment context of the Kr\u00e5kstad River catchment - a Norwegian Case Study catchment within the project.  \nThe Kr\u00e5kstad River is mainly situated in the Ski municipality in the South-Eastern part of Norway. The river catchment is a western tributary of the Vansj\u00f8-Hob\u00f8l watercourse, also known as the Morsa watercourse. The Kr\u00e5kstad River catchment area is c. 51 km\u00b2, 43% of which is agricultural land. Cereals are the major crop, produced on the heavy clays soils. The main environmental challenge in the area is water quality (incl. high phosphorus pollution) and soil erosion (incl. riverbank erosion and quick-clay landslides).The Morsa watercourse is a drinking water resource and there are specific environmental regulations for land management supported by subsidies through the Regional Environmental Programme (RMP).COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Erosion, flooding and landslides, eutrophication of rivers and lakes.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Cropland is occupied by the buffer strips, which may lead to decreased production and loss of income.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems|Living barriers","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1197, 1210","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|climate change adaptation|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 920, 921, 897, 898, 910, 914, 918, 926","readiness_level":"9.

The landform of this catchment is plain and footslpoes with gentle slope. It is obvious that, the land is prone to sheath erosion, soil fertility decline and reduced organic matter content. However, the cause of  these types of land degradation includes  direct (human and natural)  and indirect (land use supporting system).

The wealth of the people applying this technology can be categorized as poor, average and rich according to land ownership. The poor repents 20% of land users and own  4% of the cropland area. The average  category represents 64%  of the land users and own 64% of the cropland area. The rich category represents  20% of cropland users and own 32% of the cropland.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Without the land conservation there will be declining soil fertility, excessive drought, sheath erosion and plant  moisture stresses.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Declining soil fertility, moisture stress and maize stock-bores.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 917, 918, 922, 910, 914, 909, 912","readiness_level":"7.

In Uganda, extensive natural Napier grasslands grew on the fringes of tropical forest until quite recently, the grass being used as mulch for coffee plantations and, later, banana plantations.  Its use as cut fodder is more recent. \nNapier grass strips as a conservation technology was introduced to members of Farmer Field Schools in Mwizi sub-county by Kagera TAMP field facilitators. Its extensive rhizomatous root system coupled with dense, leafy clumps makes it a quickly establishing vegetative technology against soil erosion by stabilizing the soil and checking surface runoff.\nThe technology is watershed oriented, with grass strips planted on the upper side of \u0022Fanya Ju\u0022 trenches to enhance runoff checking and sediment retention.  Mulching is also used to reduce direct impact of rain-drops that otherwise loosen the top soil and worsen the process of surface erosion.   When established, grass strips form a continuous hedge along the contour, 0.5m to 1.0m high, regularly cut to provide fodder for livestock or for mulch.  The strips are 10m apart.\nPurpose of the Technology: The grass strips protect the land from surface erosion, progressively checking the speed of surface runoff, trapping sediment and increasing infiltration. Over time grass strips lead to the formation of terraces.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Napier grass is propagated  from root splits, canes with 3 nodes or from whole canes.  In the soil excavated from a shallow (0.30m to 0.60m) fanya ju trench, the planting material is planted 0.15m to 0.20m deep with splits planted upright, three node canes planted at an angle of 30-45 degrees while whole canes are buried in the furrow 0.60m to 0.90m apart. The root splits and canes are usually spaced 0.50m to 0.60m along the contour. Root splits generally take more labor to prepare  and to plant but result in quicker establishment and earlier and higher forage yields. Once the crop is well-established the original planting material type generally has little effect strip characteristics.\nThe grass strips are maintained by regular harvesting to a height of o.3m or lower depending on the amount of rain.\nNatural \/ human environment: Maintenance is simple and cheap.  Hand hoes and pangas are the only tools used in establishment and maintenance.  A little manual labor is all that is required for establishment and management. Stands can survive for decades when well-maintained, but because of its rapid growth and high yields, Napier grass requires regular application of nitrogen (N) phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the form of farm yard manure, readily available in Mwizi from the livestock that feed on the grass.  While pests and diseases that attack the Napier grass exist, it has not yet been observed to be a problem.COMMENTS:The technology is being adopted well on perennial cropland banana plantations, on moderate to steep slopes in Mwizi sub-county, Mbarara district.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): There was  erosion and plant\/crops were growing stunted.

Local grasses (for example, Andropogon gayanus, Cymbopogon schoenateus and Vetivera nigritiana) are sown or planted  (plantlets) at the start of the rainy season. Like stone bunds, grass strips are planted along the natural contour of the land to slow down runoff, increase infiltration and retain sediment. Grass strips get bigger as sediment builds up, which maintains their capacity to retain water, unlike mechanical structures (stone bunds and dikes).\nThe species of grass are chosen according to what the farmers want to use them for (straw, hay, mat weaving, roofing, construction of straw granaries, brooms, etc.). In cattle and sheep raising areas, the use of fodder plants can increase interest in this technique and ensure wider acceptance. It is recommended that the development of grass strips be combined with assisted natural regeneration (woody species) or the planting of trees.\nDesigned as an erosion control measure, grass strips slow down runoff in the event of heavy rain. They distribute rainwater more evenly over the land and improve infiltration which is particularly important when there are dry spells in the rainy season. Sediment builds up behind the grass strips, thereby reducing the erosion of fertile soil layers. The roots of the plants bind the soil and hold it in place. Although the vegetation growing in the strips competes with the crops to some extent for water, the overall effect on yields is positive. Crops are also protected from wind erosion. Thanks to the vegetation cover they provide, grass strips contribute to lowering soil temperature.\nLike contour stone bunds, grass strips reduce the harmful effects of heavy rain and violent downpours, events that are expected to increase as a result of climate change.\nCompared with plots without grass strips, millet yields were 50 kg per hectare per year higher, and straw yields 125 kg higher on plots with grass strips. Yields can be substantially improved by combining grass strips with the application of organic fertiliser, mulch or pen manure. The best results, an average increase of 280 kg of millet grain per hectare (370 kg of straw per hectare), were achieved by combining them with mulching and pen manuring. Grass strips therefore improve yields of cereals and forage for livestock (straw and grass growing on the strips).\nIncreased crop output increases household food security and improves livestock feeding. The straw cut on the grass strips can also be used for other purposes (fencing and roofing). It is also a source of income, as traditional products made with straw, such as woven mats, can be sold.\nGrass growth tends to be patchy, and resowing is required several times to fill in the gaps in the strip. In order to protect the grass strips from grazing animals during the first year, it is recommended that the area be monitored, which requires strict control over the village herds and flocks and those of nomadic livestock keepers.\nSome grasses tend to invade crop fields. It is therefore important to control  them by cutting them down before they flower and to tend the strips regularly, straightening and cutting back the edges.\nAny dead plants in the grass strips must be regularly replaced. Grass strips are more likely to be maintained if they are economically profitable, for example, if they produce hay for livestock or their output can be sold as forage or construction material.\nIt is a technique designed mainly for cropland, but can also be used on rangeland, provided that the plants are protected when the grass strips are put in place. Grass strips are suitable for areas in the Sahel and the Sudan with rainfall ranging between 400 and 1,000 mm\/year and gently sloping terrain (\u003C 2%). Ecological units that benefit from the implementation of this measure include dune land, pediments and plains (highland pediments). Grass strips are particularly appropriate for non-stony land in areas with higher rainfall levels.COMMENTS:After three seasons of promoting this technique, grass strips had been established on a total area of 4674 hectares (sometimes in combination with other measures).

The technology is designed for use on low- to medium-gradient land, referred to as \u0022tanety\u0022. During the dry season or at the start of the rainy season, contour lines are laid out by simple surveying equipment using spirit levels about 20 m apart on low slopes or closer for medium slopes. The contour lines also help to guide ploughing.  If there is no surveying equipment the strips can simply be laid out across the slope \u2013 as estimated by eye \u2013 but a surveyed contour is much preferable.\nAt the time of ploughing (between October and December), the strips - with a minimum width of 50 cm - should be left unploughed to develop natural grasses. Once the plot has been ploughed, pigeon peas can be sown on the edges of the strip every 50 cm, in staggered rows, at a rate of 2-3 seeds per seed hole. Sowing can be done at the start of the rainy season. Pigeon peas can also be planted up to 1 meter apart, still staggered, for increased seed production.\nAs the season progresses, the grassy strip will develop, and the pigeon peas will start to grow. If more than two pigeon pea plants are observed in a stand, they should be thinned. In the first year, pigeon pea production is generally modest unless the soil is very fertile. The strip should be left in place during the dry season without burning or weeding, serving as continued protection for the plot in the following season. It is then possible either to leave the pigeon peas in place, or to prune them back to 40 cm above the ground, after the first rains (if there is a fear of competition for light with other crops). In this case, the branches and dead leaves can be spread over the plot between strips as mulch or taken to the yard to feed cattle. The wood can be used as firewood.\nAfter three years, the pigeon pea plants die. The primary benefit of this technique is soil protection from erosion and the preservation of soil fertility. The pigeon pea hedge acts also as a useful windbreak providing food, fodder, and wood. It also ensures a substantial production of biomass beneficial for the soil. Because pigeon pea is a legume, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen. Furthermore, the fallen leaves of pigeon pea fertilize the plot. It is important to note that pigeon pea pods are vulnerable to insect attack.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|income increase","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 922, 917, 918, 919, 897, 898, 910, 914, 909, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

The grassed waterway slows down the surface runoff in the thalweg, increases infiltration and stabilizes the soil surface. This reduces soil erosion by water and the associated runoff of nutrients and pesticides. Fiener et al. (2005) reported a sediment retention of 80-95% and a water retention of 70-90%. Sediment is trapped mainly by water infiltration (infiltration-induced sedimentation) rather than by the filtering effect of vegetation. The conservation value of grassed waterways is not as high as for other measures, but they are still considered as a biotope network as well as a habitat for grassland breeders when extensive management practices are used (LfULG, 2010).\nGrassed waterways are typically installed in relatively large arable fields. Normally only the most vulnerable lowest area of the field needs to be grassed. The width of the area to be grassed depends on the size of the drained catchment, the physiographic characteristics of the discharge pathway (channel shape, bottom slope) and the land management (e.g. working width of the agricultural machinery). The United States Department of Agriculture (2020) recommends a total width of the grassed waterway of about 6 m in the upper part and 15 m in the lower part. On average, a grassed waterway should occupy 2% of the catchment area (LfULG, 2015).\nDuring the establishment of the vegetation, it is recommended to protect and stabilize the young plants against strong water flows, by temporary measures such as silt fences or mulching. Once the vegetation is dense enough to withstand heavy rain events, these temporary measures should be removed. After each heavy rainfall event, the waterway should be inspected for damage. Damaged areas should be filled and reseeded, and sediment deposits should be removed.\nThe choice of the seed mixture depends on the intended use and maintenance of the grassed waterway. A combination of trees and grass increases infiltration rates and natural values. Mowing should be done at least once a year, otherwise, shrubs will establish and suppress the grass. The grassed waterway should not be used as a track for vehicles because of soil compaction, and damage to vegetation. Where possible, tillage should be across the slope \u2013 therefore perpendicular to the grassed waterway in order to avoid furrows developing parallel to the waterway. A combination with conservation tillage or other erosion control practices is highly recommended (LfULG, 2010).\nGrassed waterways involve a permanent change in land-use, which means a loss of cultivable area, and associated loss of yield - and of income too if it is not covered by subsidies. Many land users dislike such structures in their fields as they impede machinery. Because land users are not always the landowners, they are not always allowed to make permanent changes in land-use. In Germany, a grassland becomes permanent after 5 years. Thus, many farmers decide to plough and replant such grassed areas every 5 years.\nThe landowner in our documentation had suffered from lodging of his oat crop along the drainage path due to heavy rainfall. Thus, he decided to undesow the oats with ryegrass. In the following year, the undersown ryegrass developed better than the oats and the farmer decided to establish ryegrass as the main crop over the whole field \u2013 rather then just in the thalweg, to avoid having to drive around it. Now he mows the area once in the spring for silage and then uses it as pasture for his horses. Every five years, he has to plough the whole area and replant it with ryegrass to prevent it from becoming permanent grassland.COMMENTS:The actual use of the grassed waterway can be very different and also depends on its dimensions. In the documented example the grassed waterway was  partially used for extensive grazing (horses).SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|minimize pesticide use|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Production|animal production|crop production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production","use_cases_id":"910, 914, 916, 921, 917, 920, 926, 918, 922, 897, 899, 898, 1186","readiness_level":"9.

Grassing is an effective preventative strategy to prevent nitrogen pollution. Reduction of nitrate pollution by grassland occurs mainly through grassland\u2019s ability to absorb and use large amounts of nitrogen compared with field crops, and this capacity remains effective for a longer period of the year. Permanent grasslands cover the soil year-round and have a large stock of active subsurface biomass in the root system, which can immobilize a significant amount of soil nitrogen. Moreover, grassland has a greater amount of active soil microbes than under field crops (Griffiths et al. 2008). Besides nitrogen remedial ability, grasslands offer other regulation and supporting ecosystem service (ES) benefits (H\u00f6nigov\u00e1 et al., 2012) \u2013 for example carbon sequestration, erosion prevention and water flow regulation. On the other hand, used too widely, grassland can be seen as a negative ES provider, in the sense that it reduces the area of crop production (Hauck et al., 2014). That is why it is recommended to limit the use of grassing so that it acts within relatively small areas focused on the catchment area. The effectiveness of grassing has been evaluated statistically, when Fu\u010d\u00edk et al. (2008) reported that an increase in grassed area of 10% can decrease the C90 (90% probability of non-exceedance) nitrate value in the waters of streams (small water courses) by 6.4 mg\/l.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"916, 920, 921, 922, 919, 917","readiness_level":"7.

The source of water is a natural source of water that sits atop a small hill which is owned by the government. From the source, water is collected in RVT ( for drinking water) and concrete irrigation pond ( for irrigation). PVC pipes are fed onto the tanks to distribute the water for multiple purposes to 4 MUWS tap towers or tap systems or \u0022Thaado\u0022. These MUWS tap towers consist of two faucets each- one for drinking and the other for irrigation and other purposes.The major purposes of this technology are to supply clean water for drinking and other multiple purposes through a cheap, effective and simple system. The natural source of water is locally maintained. Operation and maintenance works are not mandatory, however the locals are responsible for maintaining it should the need arise. The system was financed through a public-private-partnership (PPP) program; out of which some amount was funded by a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)- Sundar Nepal ( NPR. 2,77,000 ), some amount by the Village Development Committee (VDC)- (NPR. 2,63,000), and the remaining amount was collected by a locals\u2019 group (NPR. 60,000). For establishing the system, labor and construction materials were needed for building the tanks and pipeline systems. For the maintenance, manual labor is necessary. The quality of the water that is supplied to the households is good and the quantity seems sufficient for the 19 households. Sustainable use of water resources through a MUWS system, cheap and effective way to conserve water resources, ensuring availability of clean water even through dry seasons are some of the technology\u0027s advantages. Similarly, clean water, more water for irrigation for vegetable farming, simplifying day-to-day life are some of the strengths of the technology. Dislikes could be the limited availability of water during the dry season and that out of 4 systems only 2 are in operation and the other ones are in a non-working condition.\nManagement system in place for MUWS:\nA separate committee is set up for the smooth operation of the system, which consists of 20 members- 10 males and 10 females. The head of the committee is Mrs. Kopila Sunar. The committee conducts a monthly meeting to discuss the problems and need of maintenance. During the initial setup, the connection of pipelines from the tap systems to the reservoir tanks was, however, done with the contribution of the locals. Every month, each family from the 19 households contributes NPR. 100 ( One Hundred Rupees) , which goes to a fund that is set up for the times of need. The labor contribution by the people of the VDC was dependent upon the number and availability of family members in the household. Similarly, the use of the MUWS system and water from it is also dependent upon the availability of family members. Little to no maintenance was done to the system till now from 2075 B.S. ( 1 years) . Equal number of male and female members are in the committee dedicated to the MUWS system.COMMENTS:Irrigation and Multiple Uses: The locals use the technology in order to irrigate their cropland so that the plant productivity is increased. As well, the introduction of this technology has opened up doors to new possibilities like construction of tunnels ( green houses) so that the locals can grow seasonal and off-seasonal vegetables in their backyards. Animal husbandry has also been an increasing practice. Human uses like washing, cooking, cleaning, bathing, etc are amply sufficient due to adequacy of water from this technology.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Institutional|Public-private partnerships|Partnerships","type_id":"993, 1188, 1116, 1117, 1135","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Production|crop production|animal production|Farm management|field management","use_cases_id":"916, 920, 897, 898, 899, 910, 914","readiness_level":"7.

Tree density is average (6 m grid configuration) and the majority of maintenance input is limited to the first 3 years. Once established, grazing can continue with few limitations. Ceratonia siliqua (carob tree) is very characteristic of the Mediterranean region, thus blending in very well with the local landscape, especially in the rugged agro-pastoral areas of the Mediterranean islands.\nAfter the successful establishment of the plantation, intense irrigation is no longer required and livestock can be allowed in the afforested area which has been upgraded to an improved agro-pastoral or agroforestry land. This improvement facilitates a healthier ecosystem that mitigates land degradation by stabilizing soil, increasing infiltration and organic matter and promoting flora and fauna. In addition to those traits, Ceratonia siliqua is fire resistant and can promote market diversification for the farmer. The main drawback of this technology is the reduction in livestock and other crop production during the first decade of application until trees are mature.\nThe purpose of this technology is multifold. The primary goal is to increase ecosystem services provided by the treated area, especially for grazing. The farmer takes advantage of the qualities of carob trees for providing:\n(a) Fodder to the livestock from the carob pods as well as leaves from cuttings;\n(b) Shade to the livestock during the summer months;\n(c) Better soil retention, water infiltration etc.\nA secondary goal is to increase market diversification with the direct exploitation of carob beans for various products, such as carob honey and carob flour. These products give added value to the land and allow the farmer to increase his income in a more sustainable way.\nAt the same time much is gained from various other ecosystem services relevant to habitat and supporting services for the fauna of the area, such as birds and honey-bees. The aesthetic value of the landscape which strongly linked with Cretan traditions and pastoralism lifestyle is enhanced. The touristic attraction of the area is greatly improved providing new options for recreational activities and exploitation through actions such as agro-tourism.\nInitially, few structural measures are required, mostly related to preparing slopes and soil for sapling planting and establishing irrigation infrastructure. A palisade that will effectively prevent livestock from damaging young trees needs to be maintained during the first 10 years of application of the technology. 2-year-old saplings are planted in a grid configuration with spacing of 6 m and actively managed for at least 3 years. Management includes watering, fertilization and replacement of dead or weak saplings.\nThe average annual precipitation in the area is 690 mm and the climate is classified as subhumid. Average annual temperature is 17.5 oC with 7 months below 18 but above 5, thus classifying the area as subtropical. In the location where the technology is applied, land is mostly individually owned and distributed among a few families of a community of about 100 inhabitants. Although the financial means of the land user who applies this technology are more or less on par with those of the rest of the community, he has a wider empirical education and relatively higher social status acquired thought his involvement with the commons.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.05 km2.Tree and shrub cropping: Ceratonia siliqua (carob tree)\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The main problems are reduced land cover that progressively leads to soil erosion, combined with the lack of sufficient water resources in the wider area.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Land users perceive a problem of reduced pasture fodder availability thus residing to more expensive solutions\nLivestock density: 50-100 LU \/km2SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Living barriers|Native species utilization|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1210, 1201, 1206","use_cases":"Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|water use optimization for sustainability|income increase|forestry management|Access to knowledge and advisory|access to agricultural advice|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"897, 1186, 899, 910, 914, 916, 917, 921, 918, 919, 920, 1180, 927, 965, 967, 915","readiness_level":"7.

WebsterUnder conventional production systems, sugar cane is burnt before being harvested. This reduces the volume of trash - comprising green leaves, dead leaves and top growth - making harvesting of the cane simpler, and subsequent cultivation of the soil easier. In the humid tropics of North Queensland, harvesting of cane used to be carried out by hand - as it still is in many parts of the developing tropics. Burning was necessary to make harvesting possible in a dense stand (and to reduce the danger of snakes). However, with the advent of mechanical harvesters in the 1960s, burning continued to be practiced through habit.\nA new system then brought fundamental changes in soil management: The \u2018green cane trash blanket\u2019 (GCTB) technology refers to the practice of harvesting non-burnt cane, and trash blown out behind in rows by the sugar cane harvester. This trash forms a more or less complete blanket over the field. The harvested lines of cane re-grow (\u2018ratoon\u2019) through this surface cover, and the next year the cycle is repeated: the cane is once again harvested and more trash accumulates in the inter-rows. Generally the basic cropping cycle is the same, whether cane is burnt or not. This involves planting of new cane stock (cuttings or \u2018billets\u2019) in the first year, harvesting this \u2018plant crop\u2019 in the second year, and then in years three, four, five and six taking successive \u2018ratoon\u2019 harvests. In year six, after harvest, it is still common, even under the GCTB system, to burn the residual trash so that the old cane stools can be more easily ploughed out, and the ground \u2018worked up\u2019 (cultivated) ready for replanting. A minority of planters, however, are doing away with burning altogether, and ploughing in the residual trash before replanting. A further variation is not to plough out and replant after the harvest in year six, but to spray the old cane stock with glyphosat (a broad spectrum non-selective systemic herbicide) to kill it, then to plant a legume (typically soy bean) as a green manure crop, and only replant the subsequent year after ploughing-in the legume. Under this latter system, one year of harvest is lost, but there are added benefits to the structure and nutrient content of the soil.\nWhatever variation of GCTB is used, there are advantages in terms of increased organic matter, improved soil structure, more biodiversity (especially below ground) and a marked reduction in surface erosion - from over 50 t\/ha to around 5 t\/ha on average. Less erosion is good for the growers - but is also of crucial importance off-site, as sediment lost from the coastal sugar cane strip is washed out to sea, and damages the growing coral of the Great Barrier Reef.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Conventional burning of sugar cane before harvest can lead to compaction of top soil and reduced organic matter. There is also, despite the low slopes, a serious problem of sheet\/rill erosion that has a negative impact both on the fields, and also off-site on the coral reef.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): soil erosion, weeds, floodingSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Harvesting and processing equipment|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1192, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Production|crop production|climate change mitigation|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 917, 922, 897, 898, 919, 910, 914, 909, 925","readiness_level":"9.

A sustainable fruit orchard management has the ambition to combine fruit production with the maintenance of soil fertility. The increase or preservation of soil fertility can be supported by means of soil management techniques, such as green cover. Compared with systems that does not use a permanent soil protection, green cover provides long-term agronomical and environmental benefits due to a reduction of negative impacts on agro-ecosystems. The technology is an effective practice to provide a natural supply of mineral elements to the soil surface, while the stabilisation of root system improves the soil physical properties. Moreover, the permanent soil cover prevents water erosion and limits the leaching of nutrients (particularly nitrates) and pesticides.\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of adopting a permanent green cover in orchards is the prevention of soil and water degradation, especially soil erosion by heavy rainfall events and water. Secondary purpose is restoring soil biodiversity through the soil protection from pesticides, heavy machinery equipment and loss of soil structure.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Green cover comprises naturally occurring, or sown, perennial grasses which form the permanent soil cover. The stabilisation of an herbaceous covering over the years allows the passage of machinery after rainfall events by improving the efficiency of farming operations. Due to the competition with fruit trees  for nutrients, during the first 2-3 years following orchard plantations the soil is handled without a continuous cover or with a large strip of bare soil around the row. After system stabilisation, green vegetation is periodically cut, depending on the seasonal variability, and left on the soil surface as mulch.\nNatural \/ human environment: If water is not a limiting factor for fruit production, the permanent vegetation cover is the best way to improve soil physical properties and generally soil fertility with a low  economic investment. Moreover the technology acts as a filter for water depuration due to a reduction of water runoff and the consequent deposition of suspended solids sediment-bound nutrients.COMMENTS:Major cash crop perennial cropping: Apple, pear, peach, kiwi\nGrass species: fescue, ryegrass, orchard grass, clover\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soils in the Veneto region generally suffer from a loss of soil organic matter (SOM) that is strongly affected by their natural texture and climatic conditions. In tree cropping systems, where permanent green cover is not applied, the problem of loss of soil fertility is associated with degradation of water resources due to sediment transportation and contaminations by excessive nutrients and pesticides.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Production|crop production|water use optimization for sustainability|minimize pesticide use|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 917, 897, 898, 920, 926, 918, 919, 922","readiness_level":"9.

The vineyards are, for micro-climatic reasons, sited on the southwest facing slope close to the lake. Annual rainfall is about 1,000 mm, with at least one erosive storm per year, and the soils are highly erodible. In conventional viniculture all weeds are controlled chemically. The \u2018green cover technology\u2019 comprises sown, or naturally occurring, perennial grasses and herbs which form a biodiverse green cover - a \u2018living mulch\u2019 - over the soil surface between vine rows. In this region, rows are generally oriented up and down the slope for ease of machine operation. Green cover may also be applied where vines are grown on narrow bench terraces. The purpose is the prevention of soil degradation, especially soil erosion by water. Secondary purposes include protection of the soil surface from compaction when using mechanised equipment, and promotion of biodiversity.\nGreen cover is generally established naturally - except on contour-planted terraced vineyards, where cover is planted for immediate stabilisation of the terraces. To avoid competition, a 10-40 cm diameter zone around the freshly planted vines is kept free from vegetation: during the three year establishment period it is removed by hoe, later it is controlled with herbicides (either as a strip along vine rows or around individual vines). The topsoil between the vine rows is ripped every few years with an implement pulled by a small caterpillar tractor. The green cover vegetation is cut, chopped and left as mulch several times using special mulching machines. These operations are not carried out over the whole field at once: alternate rows are left untouched to ensure that some vegetation remains to maintain biodiversity. When these rows redevelop their green cover, the others are then treated. This is effectively a minimum tillage system, building up organic matter in the soil. Cutting and mulching, in addition to ripping, serves to circulate nutrients. Mineral fertilizer and herbicides are applied once a year around the vines. Experiments with the technology started in the 1970s, but green cover has now become standard practice.\nSupportive measures include not removing crop residues (from vineyards) which are chopped later - simultaneously with the cover crop (grass) - to protect the soil surface, and irrigation in dry years.COMMENTS:The technology is applied in all wine growing regions of Switzerland, but under different conditionsMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The main problem was decreasing soil fertility, especially through soil erosion by water, caused by lack of soil cover and intensive cultivation. There were associated negative offsite effects including sand\/sediment deposition and contamination of groundwater by nutrients. This became a serious problem from the 1960s when the traditional labour-intensive methods were superseded by a mechanised-industrial agricultural system.\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: a vine plantation is established for a period of 20-40 years (lifetime of a vine). Some farmers make one year of fallow between the destruction of the old and the establishment of a new plantation.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1197","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|minimize pesticide use|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|optimization of resource use for better production|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 921, 922, 926, 910, 914, 897, 898, 909, 920, 918","readiness_level":"9.

However, they also play a role in covering the ground and protecting it from solar radiation and soil erosion. These are plants that are deliberately grown for incorporation into the soil to improve soil fertility and organic matter content. They are generally fast-growing legumes sown in a field several weeks or months before the main crop is planted. Legumes are chosen due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, their drought tolerance, quick growth, and adaptation to adverse conditions. Green manures have the potential to restore soil fertility and have an ameliorating effect on climate change via the sequestration of atmospheric carbon.\nGreen manures supply the soil with great amounts of fresh biomass. After incorporation into the soil, the biomass is decomposed by soil organisms within a few weeks under humid and warm conditions. Most nutrients are then readily available to a new crop. A small proportion is also transformed into stable soil organic matter, contributing to better soil structure, better aeration, improved drainage, increased soil water and nutrient holding capacity, and reduced erodibility of the soil by wind or water.  Soil microbial activity is increased, as is the availability of macro and micronutrients in forms that the plants can use. They also have a root system that holds the soil in place. \nGreen manures are often applied to degraded land that demands management interventions. The purpose of introducing the technology reported here is primarily to multiply seeds for the scaling out of the technology. Among the common green manure crops which are being used in Ethiopia are lupin and lablab. Land users benefit from the sale of the seed itself as well as the fact that green manures increase production and help to changes unproductive and abandoned land into productive assets.

The green leaf biomass is very suitable as green manure for annual crops, since the plant has a high content of nitrogen and phosphurus, and decomposes quickly after application to the soil: its nutrients are released within one growing season.\nPurpose of the Technology: Tithonia biomass enhances soil organic matter and soil fertility, resulting in higher crop yields. The treatment supplies the crop with nutrients at the early stage of the growing process, and thus improves the establishment of the crops through the early development of a good rooting system. The technology is especially beneficial for maize: yields in the study area increased by over 50%.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: At an early stage of plant growth, fresh green leaves and stems are cut, chopped and applied on the cropland as green manure after the first pass of ridging. The fresh material is spread over the half-made ridges at a ate of 2 kg per m2 and then covered with about 5-10 cm of soil to finish the ridges. Sowing of crop seeds is done only after a week or more, because of heat generation during the decomposition process of the leaves (which could damage the seeds).\nNatural \/ human environment: Tithonia can also be applied as mulch 6 to 8 weeks after planting the crop. Covering the mulch with a little soil facilitates nutrient release. Tithonia green manuring - before planting - and mulching can be combined, which is especially applicable to maize, beans and cabbage cultivation. Tithonia hedgerows have to be cut back regularly; otherwise it can spread fast and become a weed.

JonesWhile Grevillea robusta (the \u2018silky oak\u2019, an Australian native tree) was originally introduced from India to East Africa as a shade tree for tea and coffee estates, it is now more commonly associated with small-scale farming areas. There are three main forms of grevillea agroforestry systems: (1) most commonly trees are planted along farm boundaries, initially at a close spacing (0.75-1 m), then later thinned to 1.5-3 m, giving approximately 400 plants\/ha; (2) scattered grevillea trees associated with annual or perennial crops: resembling open forests with multi-storey layers; (3) grevillea is sometimes grown in a form of \u2018alley cropping\u2019 on terraces, with 4\u20138 m interval between the rows and a spacing of 3-5 m within the rows.\nGrevillea is primarily used in combination with annual (maize\/beans) and perennial crops (coffee). It can be easily propagated and established and is relatively free of pests and diseases. Trees are managed through periodic pollarding - the pruning of side branches (for use) while maintaining the trunk. This gives the visual impression of \u2018telegraph poles\u2019, but competition with crops (which is little, in any case) is reduced and pruned branches rapidly regrow. An additional measure for avoiding competition with crops is to dig a small trench around the trees, thus cutting the superficial roots.\nGrevillea is planted for a number of purposes. These include marking property boundaries, supplying fuelwood and building materials, providing shade and for ornamental value. Simultaneously it can control raindrop splash (when an understorey of litter builds up beneath), increases organic matter, and provides mulching materials to improve ground cover in the farm. Grevillea reduces wind speed, and encourages nutrient recycling due to its deep rooting.\nWhile the climate in the case study area is subhumid, and the slopes moderate to steep with soils of medium erodibility, grevillea can be planted over a wide range of agroecological zones - from semi-arid to humid zones, and from sea level up to 2,000 metres and higher. It is ideally suited to intensive areas of small-scale mixed farming, where grevillea is valued primarily for the supply of products (fuel and construction wood in particular) to meet various household needs: it is not mainly targeted at soil erosion control though this is achieved in various ways as explained above. To effectively combat soil erosion problems on slopes, grevillea planting must be combined with additional measures such as fanya juu and bench terraces, grass strips and other vegetative and agronomic forms of conservation.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 1.5 km2.Main products\/ services: grevillea trees, maize\/beans, coffee, macadamia and banana\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): - land degradation, mainly by water erosion\n- soil fertility decline due to continuous cropping and few inputs\n- lack of fuelwood, building materials, and other tree related products\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Soil fertility decline\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: After land preparation, maize is planted followed by the legumes (mainly beans), depending on the rainfall regimeSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1197, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|forestry management|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 921, 927, 918, 922, 917, 909","readiness_level":"9.

The soil type is moderately fertile with low moisture content  that favours tree growth. These trees are planted as boundary lines for providing shade on a pineapple cropland, nitrogen fixation, increasing soil organic matter, providing fuel wood and as a source of timber for construction after 5-8 years. The tree species generally grows well under the mono-modal (one rainfall season) rainfall pattern of Northern Uganda.\nPlanting is normally done during the wet season at the onset of rain in early April and the inputs required for establishing this technology include Grevillea Robusta seedlings majorly provided by the District forestry officers, farmyard manure, hand hoes and spades. A hand hoe is used to dig pits about 0.5 m deep, 0.6 m wide and 3 to 5 m apart and 1 meter away from the pineapple crop. Farmyard manure is added to the pit to fill a depth of about 0.3 m, a layer of top soil is added to 0.2 m depth and the seedling is planted on top. The rest of the pit is filled with soil and watered to improve soil moisture content. Bamboo canes can be woven around the seedlings to protect them from destruction by livestock. Grevillea Robusta grows fast when the boundary line is well established within two years. The pruned branches provide fuel wood for domestic use like cooking and within 5 to 8 years the trees are harvested for timber. Establishment costs for this technology are normally higher compared to maintenance costs especially for the purchase of Grevillea seedlings, manures, farm equipment like hand hoes and pangas. The technology is easily and spontaneously adopted by average smallholder farmers with less than 2 acres and is useful for providing shade to the pineapple crop thus increasing the yield. What is not liked about this technology is that it forms a big canopy that limits photosynthesis. To maintain this technology, the land user has to constantly prune whenever the canopy grows big.COMMENTS:The map shows the land user\u0027s Grevillea Robuster garden which is used as wind break and provides shade to the pineapple garden.Fast growing woody leguminous trees provide shade, shelter from winds, soil fertility maintenance and timber production after 5-8 years.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|Farm management|field management|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|income increase|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 927, 910, 914, 921, 909, 915, 1180, 917, 922, 918","readiness_level":"9.

The sides of the ponds are grown with grassy vegetation to stabilize soil, as well as feed the fish. It is, therefore imperative that farmers who want to invest in such sustainable land management practice first seek professional advice from extension agents or from other experienced farmers, on post-harvest fish handling and preservation. In Northern Uganda, fish theft and poisoning are also rampant, especially where ponds are not properly guarded or fenced. The most costly aspects of pond fish farming include pond excavation, laboratory testing of water and surrounding soil properties; procurement of fries especially tilapia, fencing and procurement of fish feeds. The average cost of establishing each pond is approximately US$428; while putting fish firies establishment goes for an average of US$ 71 per pond.\nIt is important to note that at the beginning the capital investments are high; these include paying for construction and buying fish fries to put in the ponds.

Up to 200 t\/ha of stems could be harvested. The growing technique is simple. One-off costs for planting Arundo will bring benefits to a farmer for at least 60 years without any additional costs. In the wild and on farmlands, the roots of arundo grow horizontally and in the fall they develop large growth buds in the form of a cone 0.03 m in height and 0.05 m in diameter. In the spring, these buds form above-ground sprouts. To plant the reeds, the roots together with the growth buds should be dug out from the wet soil and cut off with the pruning shears, so that each rootstock has a growth bud. The reeds are then planted in 3-8 m wide belts around the house (150-400m\u00b2). In autumn and winter, the planting area is fenced with an earth mound 25x25cm in height and filled with water. Then the land levelling  takes place. The soil is spaded to a depth of 20cm, harrowed and planting furrows 15m in height are formed at with 60cm between each row. The area should then be fenced to keep out animals. The rootstocks and growth buds, prepared in advance, are planted perpendicular to the surface of the planting holes in furrows 0.4 m apart and covered with soil.

During the Soviet era the State allocated funds for the implementation of agricultural practices, considering that agriculture was subsidised by the state. Under such conditions, farmers did not have much interest in applying progressive techniques, for example minimum tillage. In the post-Soviet era, the farming conditions changed; land tenure was changed to private ownership; and agronomic practices are now covered entirely by the farmers. Implementation of the traditional moldboard ploughing at a the depth of 20-25 cm over many years led to the formation of a subsurface compact layer in the clayey soil, which prevents vertical filtration of water and air exchange, negatively impacting the life of aerobic soil microorganisms and decreasing the cereals\u2019 yield. It resulted in the necessity of destroying such layers periodically with the help of a subsoil cultivator, attached to a plough carriage and entailing high fuel costs.\nUsing minimum tillage the field is cultivated at a depth of 10-12 cm by a tractor with a disker and simultaneously harrowed immediately after the harvest.  Minimum tillage creates an even and loose field cover without inner capillaries through which the moisture can quickly evaporate. The productive moisture reserve at this sowing depth is 30% higher in comparison to soil preparation by usual ploughing, and therefore increasing seed germination in the field. An additional advantage of minimum tillage is lower CO2 emissions from soil in comparison with mouldboard ploughing. Through applying minimum tillage, the activity of subterranean micro fauna (earthworm, predatory beetles) improves.. Furthermore, there is no need to even the soil, which reduces the tillage number and allows for greater conservation of fuel and lubricant, as well as reducing labour costs. The ridge sowing technology is applied in CIS countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan.) in the production of wheat and other cereals. Kyrgyzstan first applied this technology with the support of the SIDA project \u201cSupport to seed development industry in Kyrgyzstan\u201d. Further dissemination of this method was supported by the Seed Growers\u2019 Association of Kyrgyzstan.  This technology was utilized in Kyrgyzstan through the use of the Turkish seeder \u0421BP-2,8, which forms ridges, sows and simultaneously cuts furrows to irrigate between the ridges.  The ridge sowing technology creates optimal conditions for agricultural crops and provides effective furrow irrigation. This prevents excessive use of irrigation water (saving 25-30%) and irrigation erosion, which happens in the case of using flooding methods on the crop fields using common corn planters. In addition, it prevents the flooding of useful soil micro fauna, as well as saves time. Prior to irrigation or after irrigation, a tractor or agricultural machine can easily go along the irrigation furrows to spray plants with herbicides and pesticides.  Ridge sowing of cereals can be implemented almost on all types of grey-brownish, grey, red, yellow soil types with middle and light mechanical composition. In addition to cereals, ridge sowing can be used for growing vegetables and legumes (including potato), as well as industrial and oil crops (sugar beet, rape, soya bean, sesame)\nDepending on natural climatic conditions and biological peculiarities of the cultivated varieties, width between the ridges is about 60-70cm. 2-3 rows of seeds can be sown on the ridges with a row spacing of 15cm. Over the course of 3 years, 10 ha of land were sown by using this technology, and the wheat grain yield was not reduced in comparison to the conventional cultivation method using a corn planter.  While sowing cereals with such a seeder, it is recommended to cultivate well-bushing varieties. The ridge seeder decreases the seeding rate to a minimum.  The seeding rate of cereals is 100-150kg\/ha instead of 200-250kg\/ha when using the usual sowing method with a classical corn planter and provides additional yield  of winter grain wheat up to   5 -8,3 centner\/ha. Practice is documented in the frame of CACILM.\nPurpose of the Technology: Eliminate soil compaction; reduce evaporation of moisture and \u0421\u041e2 from soil; create optimal conditions for soil micro fauna; increase yield and reduce fuel consumption costs while tilling soil\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The essential element of this technology is that a farmer or farmers\u2019 organization owns a disk tiller, which costs about 1000 USD\nNatural \/ human environment: Minimum tillage is applied on grey-brownish soils; with a humus content of 3- 6%. \u201cMIS\u201d JSC is comprised of approximately 50 farmers. Over 100 ex-farmers of the \u201cMIS\u201d JSC received their land shares and organized the peasants\u2019 farms (PF). All these farmers communicate with each other and exchange experiences. Therefore, both \u201cMIS\u201d JSC members and other farmers apply minimum tillageCOMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 2 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The use of obsolete machinery and technologies reduces soil fertility and the amount of moisture in the soil; suppresses life activity of soil micro fauna and needs high power inputs.

Farmers using the drip irrigation system with their corn crops is an adaptation to climate change, in periods such as during the drought period. It\u2019s reduces unnecessary evaporation, saves labor and time, improves crop growth and makes it possible to produce a high yield because of a sufficient water supply.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Nary LayThe use of a drip irrigation system is an efficient method that saves water by letting it seep through the drainage network directly into the corn clumps at regular intervals (the seepage rate is 6 liters\/hour and the pressure of the water flow is between 1.2 to 2 bar). Moreover, the drip system helps to maintain moisture around the roots of a crop and does not distribute water to superfluous areas at a distance from the crop (John, 2018). In doing so it reduces the weed proficiency and also insures that enough water is provided for the crop especially during the flowering phase. This is essential because a lack of water during this phase can have a significant impact on crop yields. At the same time the use of this drip system enables farmers to adapt to climate change through the efficient use of water especially in areas that experience the adverse impacts of climate change like droughts. Furthermore, a liquid fertilizer can also be directly fed into the drip irrigation system.\nIn order to cultivate corn one should first scatter cow manure on the ground and then plow the soil three times after which it should be left to dry for seven days. After that it should be plowed again and then the soil is prepared for the ridging of the rows. Once the ridges have been created the drip irrigation system should be installed. This technology was applied on a plot of land with an area of 2301.5 square meters. \nIn order to nurse the seedlings, the farmer should mix the soil from a termite mound (or other fertile soil) with other materials. The ratio should be 1 portion of fertile soil, with 2 portions of rice husk embers and 2 portions of animal manure. Then this mixture is put into trays and then one corn seed is embedded into each cell. After the seedlings are one week old they should be transplanted. The farmer should use a bamboo stick to dig holes to a depth of 3 cm and then firstly apply D A P (18-46-0) fertilizer after which the seedlings are placed in the holes. Nursery seedlings are healthy and well-balanced as they grow, do not die easily, and produce a higher yield than seeds that are directly planted into the ground. These always have to be replanted as some seeds do not grow, and they tend to not germinate as well as the nursery seedlings. Farmers should plant two lines of seedlings in each row with a gap of 55cm between the lines. Along each of the lines there should be a gap of 30cm between one plant and the next. Farmers are able to grow corn twice a year, once from July to September and the other from February to April.\nDuring the rainy season farmers only need to use the irrigation system for about 10 to 15 minutes in the morning or evening once the land is dry, such as when there has been no rainfall for many days or also on occasions of inadequate rainfall. In the dry season farmers water the corn twice a day for about 30 minutes each time, once in the morning and once in the evening. During the dry season 6 to 7 litters of water are used to irrigate the corn, thereby the water flow rate being 6 liters per hour. Depending on the variation in water pressure the flow rate of this drip irrigation system can range between 1 to 4 gallons per hour (1 gallon = 3,785 liters).\nThe farmers were supported financially by the HARVEST project in 2014 to cover the costs of the drip irrigation system and so their only expenses included the preparation of the seeds, other agricultural inputs and maintenance costs. Regarding the water use for the dry season crop on this area of land, only 600-700 cubic meters of water were consumed, which the farmer sourced from a pond and a small river.\nThe use of the drip irrigation system helps to reduce the amount of labor necessary for the irrigation of the corn, saves time, is able to maintain unimpaired crop growth when there is not enough water, saves water, and also reduces the growth of weeds between the plants. Therefore, this system facilitates the efficient use of water, helps to adapt to conditions brought on by climate change such as droughts, and is especially beneficial in areas where there is a scarce supply of water.COMMENTS:Livestock density: Raise 5 cowsSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 908, 909, 910, 914, 912, 916, 918, 920, 921","readiness_level":"7.

Weeds reduce farm and forest productivity, by depriving them of soil nutrients and water, the latter especially during dry seasons. \nMajority of farmers in northern Uganda weed fields using rudimentary methods such as hand-hoeing and hand picking; both of which are manual and ineffective. Mechanized and herbicide weeding methods are out of reach of typical small scale farmers in the region. Moreover, alternative, more cost effective and environmentally augmenting natural weed control methods such as cover crops or living mulch exist, but are yet to be adopted widely in the region. Cover crops are creeping leguminous crops such as Macuna beans (mucuna pruriens) and local wild beans, which are planted in fields purposely to suppress weeds, control runoff and soil erosion, conserve soil moisture, fix nitrogen, regulate soil temperature, improve soil structure and provide fodder for livestock. \nIn northern Uganda, cover crops are usually planted at a spacing of 2 meter by 2 meter (see figure below) and in holes of 5 cm depth. Cover mulches are generally planted after the main crops have been harvested to minimize cover crop-main crop competition for resources. Nevertheless, planting while the main crop is growing in the field is also possible. However, the main crops should be given up to five weeks to establish before planting your cover crop.\nThe cover crop technology, being a natural phenomenon is usually affordable by typical small scale farmers in northern Uganda. The only challenge is to access to quality seed of suitable cover crops. Otherwise, after sowing the first and purchased seed, the farmer uses own seed harvested from previous crops for subsequent season sowing. However, the farmer needs to ensure that cover crops do not become invasive in cropping fields. This is done by clearing cover crops just before their fruits mature. As such, only a portion of the cover crop to be left for seed purpose is allowed growth to full maturity.COMMENTS:The other location is mapped for available seed of a good cover crop (in Gulu)SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|plant health|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|minimize pesticide use|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 906, 910, 914, 916, 917, 921, 922, 926, 909","readiness_level":"7.

The field covers the entire landscape and is neighboured by a cassava plantation. Within the same field, contour trenches were established to separate one pasture field from the other, and to also prevent soil and nutrient loss within the field. Pastures planted include Chloris gayana (rhodes grass), Brachiaria mulato (signal grass) and Pennisetum (napier grass). All grasses are native to East Africa.\nEach pasture type on each plot is planted as a pure stand; the Chloris field lies on a 3000 m2 plot size, the Brachiaria field lies on 1000 m2 plot size and the Pennisetum field lies on a 4000 m2 plot size.\n-Chloris gayana was planted at a spacing of 30 cm inter row and broadcasted within the rows, the seeds were mixed with sand before they were broadcasted. Thereafter the seeds were                     covered lightly with soils to enable easy germination of the tiny seeds.\n-Brachiaria mulato was planted at a spacing of 60X 60cm\n-Napier was  planted at 75x 60cm.\nPrior to establishment of the pastures, the plots were cleared of the bush, ploughed twice  and harrowed to make a fine seed bed before planting. Two tonnes of animal manure was added. The following  equipment was used:\n-Hand hoes\n-3 slashers\n-A spirit level for leveling the contour trenches\nPlanting material for all the grasses was provided by the Rwebitaba Zonal Agricultural Research and Development Institute (RwebiZARDI) in form of root tillers for Brachiaria, seeds for Chloris and cuttings for the Pennisetum grass.\nKyegegwa is one of the districts where conflicts between livestock keepers and crop farmers are increasing. This kind of pressure does not allow free range grazing any more. Therefore the pastures  planted were not only to provide better quality and quantity feeds for the dairy project throughout the year but also to reduce on conflicts with neighbours. Chloris gayana yields between 20-27t DM\/ha and was planted to provide hay. It is drought tolerant, has a high regeneration capacity, easy to digest and is rich in carbohydrates, while Bracharia mulato is also palatable and often used in a cut \u0026amp; carry system. Bracharia is easy to conserve as compared to other grasses and is rich in proteins. Napier grass was planted for its early maturity, regeneration capacity, especially during the rainy season and just like Brachiaria easy to makes silage. The improved pastures are suitable for both cut \u0026amp; carry and grazing and they are tolerant to drought therefore providing a sustainable feed base for the diary all year round.  The pastures were also planted to act as a fallow, thereby also improving soil fertility.  \nEstablishment costs were estimated to be at UGX 1,396,000 while maintenance costs were estimated to be at UGX 320,000 per annum. Improved pastures are advantageous because they provide more nutrients than local pastures; Chloris provides more carbohydrates whereas Brachiaria and Penisetum provide more protein. Pastures rehabilitate degraded land by acting as vegetation cover for longer periods hence reducing soil erosion and increasing soil fertility. They control broad leaved weeds and a small piece of land is used to cut and carry for stock.

However, one innovative land user began to set up on a slope with 60% steepness, a 3 ha plot for intensive grass \/ fodder production through his own initiative. By the application of irrigation, within 3-5 years the very low productive grazing land was converted into a highly productive and sustainable cut-and-carry system. The technology is very effective in these ecological conditions for rapid rehabilitation of degraded lands. Over the 18 years of on-going fodder production on the plot, the pure alfa-alfa culture transformed into a grass-bean mixture, which provides even better soil cover and soil conservation.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose is secured fodder production for keeping livestock in the winter time. Despite the steep slope of 60%, and low-productive soils, by applying irrigation, the farmer gets three harvests of hay per season, amounting to about 8-12 ton of high quality fodder. Thus, over all these years, the farmer has had no problems producing sufficient fodder for his livestock.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The establishment of such a plot is very labour-intensive. However, within 3-4 years the productivity of the land improves several times over. High yields of high quality hay can be obtained within the short term, and the labour intensive activities are mostly needed just within the first year of establishment. Thus, many farmers have been attracted to apply this technology.\nNatural \/ human environment: The plot described is situated in the village of Ravgada, Jamoat Teharv in Vanj district. Vanj is one of the two districts of GBAO with favourable agro-climatic conditions. But even here the natural fertility of the stony soils is low, especially on pasture lands with sparse vegetation. Due to the high aridity, farming is not possible without irrigation. The main income of the population is from livestock and the sale of nuts and fruits.

Stylo 184) is a leguminous shrub which is used in pastures and as fodder crop. It is drought tolerant and can be harvested during the whole year, though it grows only when sufficient water is available. Mangos (Mangifera indica) are grown mainly from seeds in the area, either as single trees in home gardens or as orchards. The farmer of this case study has a mango orchard of 0.6 ha with trees spaced 6 by 8 meters, and grows stylo grass as a cover crop under and between the trees. Each day a patch of stylo grass is harvested by hand, and around 40 kg of this fodder is fed to the cattle together with rice straw. This allows the farmer to keep more cattle than before, 11 heads instead of 5. The mangos are mainly sold on the market, and some are dried. This agroforestry system reduces erosion by wind and water, as the soil is covered the whole year and the trees slow down the wind. The cattle can be kept near the house, which is good for making compost and biogas.\nIn 2004, the farmer cleared a forest and planted mango seedling. Between the mangos, he grew pumpkins, watermelons and cucumbers, but even though he used compost the soil fertility deteriorated fast and the cucurbits did not produce anymore. A local NGO, LAREC (Local Agricultural Research and Extension Centre), was looking for farmers with enough cattle and land in the area to try stylo grass, which was unknown in the area. The farmer, first reluctant because his other crops were not producing, started to plant stylo grass seeds he got from the NGO in July 2013 (information for this documentation was collected one year after the start).To do so, he plouwed and harrowed the fields with the hand tractor, and broadcasted the seeds by hand. After the first 3 months, during which he needed to weed, he started harvesting the fodder, and he cut 40 kg a day, one patch after another, 20 cm from the soil. This allows the reproduction of this cover crop.\nThe land user wants to expand his stylo grass to his other mango orchard, and is collecting seeds for this. Other farmers in the area are also interested in this technology; and the land user of this case-study starts to sell them stylo grass seeds but does not produce enough for all yet.\nThe analysed area is mostly flat (slope \u003C 2%), tropic (dry and wet season), and the soils are mostly sandy or loamy. The soils contain little organic matter (low soil fertility, acidification, small amount of cattle, area has been deforested) and the groundwater table is rather high (3 m below soil level during the dry season, on the surface during the wet season).\nDue to climate change, the rainfalls are more erratic, temperatures rise and droughts are more recurrent. Rice is the predominant crop grown in the area, since it serves as staple food (mix subsistence and commercial activities). Rice is often grown in monocultures and harvested once a year. Once the rice is harvested (dry season), some farmer release cattle to the paddy fields to eat the straw and weeds.\nAs an addition to rice, most land users grow vegetable and fruits in small home gardens (subsistence) and complement their income by producing handicrafts or through off farm income \/ remittances from family members working in other places. The increasing migration rate (the young generation leaves the villages to work in the cities, garment industry or abroad) results in a decrease of available labour force in the area which has detrimental effects on the agricultural activities. Furthermore, the civil war in the 1970s (Khmer Rouge) led to the loss of agricultural knowledge which different NGOs try to re-establish.COMMENTS:0.6 haMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Lack of organic matter, lack of water retention in soil, irregularity of rainfall, low soil fertility (sandy soil), monocultures, bare soil during dry season.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Low soil fertility, lack of water, soil erosion by water on the slope.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1076","use_cases":"Production|animal production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|income increase|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Access to knowledge and advisory|access to agricultural advice","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 898, 910, 914, 916, 918, 921, 909, 1180, 917, 965, 967","readiness_level":"7.

Additionally, it prevents the vegetables from being damaged by rainfall wind and sunlight.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Nary LayCurrently one of the major challenges farmer face when growing vegetables is the damage caused by insects. Moreover, climate change creates obstacles when cultivating crops such as irregular rainfall, strong winds, and a rise in temperature. In order to address these issues the farmers trialed the growing of vegetables under a nethouse. Nethouses also enable crop growing throughout the whole year.\nThe main purpose of building a nethouse is to ward off insects without having to apply pesticides. A nethouse is highly effective in damage reduction caused by insects on crop from 80% to 100% (Stilers, 2011). Also farmers noticed that there\u0027s no significant insect infestation when using this technology. The netted roof helps to protect vegetables from direct rainfall onto them as this can damage plants or splashes soil on plant\u0027s leaves. As well it is slowing down the speed of rainfall and split it into small droplets, which is important to improve the cultivation of vegetables during rainy season, (usually farmer can grow vegetables only during dry season).\nNethouses come in a range of different size and height, and construction materials also differ depending on the available resources. Before setting up a nethouse, farmer will firstly have to prepare the terrain and then mark out the points where posts will be installed (generally it is rectangular in shape) and dig holes measuring 0.40 meters x 0.40 meters with a depth of 1 meter at all of the marked out point. After post have been inserted into these holes they should be filled with concrete to a height of 60 cm so as to secure post (the length of side post are 3 meters and the middle post are 4 meters). After frame completion, nylon ropes are extended. They act as frames to support the net and then lastly, the net is rolled over the frame to cover the entire nethouse (the sides of net should be buried in ground at a depth of 25 cm). There are two common types of nethouse roofs, those being either a gable roof or a curved (gambrel) roof, which is better than a flat roof that risks breaking down when water accumulates on it during heavy rainfalls.\nFarmers generally use the same cultivation techniques as other farmers. The differences lie in the nethouse, in nearly no use of chemical fertilizers and in complete elimination of pesticide. The interviewed farmer established a nethouse measuring 316.25 square meters at Tasei village, Tameun commune (Thmakoul district). The land selected by the farmer for such nethouse vegetable growing was previously a rice field.  He considered that rice can only be grown once a year, whereas vegetables can be grown throughout the year. Thus, it is possible to generate more income. They decided to dig a large pond (35meter x 35meter) for water storage connected to the irrigation system, which disburden him from watering during dry season. Initially, the excavated soil was less fertile, but the farmer used compost for one year, after which it was possible to improve the soil quality. The farmer makes dry and liquid compost by himself and also uses organic fertilizer which is purchased externally. The liquid compost is made up of sugar palm 1 kg, pineapple 5 kg and coconut juice 2 liters. This practice adds nutrients to soil and promotes a lot of living organisms that make crops flourish.\nComparing the construction costs and time it takes to make a profit from sale of vegetables farmers have to have at least three harvests before they can cover the cost of the nethouse or to achieve the profit. The nethouse can be used for a period of 10 to 13 years, and it is only necessary to change the nylon net once it is ripped. The actual gross income from pok choi and escarole is 1,590,000 riels for 530 kilograms.\nIf he continued to produce rice on this land, this would generate 100kg of rice sold at about 800 riels per kg and so, he would gain 80,000 riels per year. However, as the farmer applies this technology he can grow vegetable several times per year (6-7 times) with an average yield of 530 kg per harvest that amounts to 3,180 kg per year. If one kilogram of vegetables is worth 3000 riel he is able to generate an income of around 9,540,000 riel, which is more than hundredfold that of rice. Additionally, he is able to produce safe vegetables, contributes to the reduction in environmental pollution and the technology is adapted to climate change.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|minimize pesticide use|field management|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 918, 926, 914, 921, 915, 920","readiness_level":"7.

The checks are flat across the top, except for one end which is lowered to act as a spillway for overflow. As has been pointed out already, these are constructed in stages every rainy season, keeping pace with the rate of siltation. Stone for construction is collected from around the farm.

Gullies are continuously expanding, and constitute a significant proportion of the catchment. These cause considerable loss of cropland as well as downstream damage to the city of Cochabamba.\nA combination of structural and vegetative measures was designed and implemented with the purpose of: (1) preventing affected areas from further degradation by safely discharging runoff from the surrounding area through the main gullies down to the valley; (2) gradually stabilising the land through the regeneration of vegetative cover; (3) reducing downstream damage through floods and siltation; (4) ensuring accessibility to the mountainous agricultural area during the rainy season.\nCut-off drains at the heads of the gullies, reinforced with stones inside the channel and grassed bunds below, concentrate runoff and cascade it down over stone steps back into the waterways. Flow is controlled by stone and wooden check dams and discharged safely. Sediment is trapped behind these structures and terraces develop. Bushes or trees are planted above and below the check dams. Depending on availability of materials, wooden check dams are sometimes used and associated with tree planting (four trees above and four below each check dam).\nThese practices are complemented by SWC measures throughout the catchment: biotrampas are staggered sediment traps located on the steep lateral slopes. They comprise ditches behind wooden barriers where soil accumulates. Biotrampas create suitable sites for tree\/bush planting while stabilising the hillsides, reducing erosion, increasing infiltration and slowing siltation of the check dams in the watercourses. Supporting technologies include fenced-off areas for reforestation of the lateral slopes\/upper edge of the gully, and finally large gabion dams at the outlets of the gullies, usually 10-25 m in length, but exceptionally up to 200 m.\nAfter a few years vegetation should have stabilised the system, and effectively replaced the wooden and stone constructions. The various practices enhance each other. Establishment is labour demanding, but other costs are low, as long as the material in question is locally obtainable. Maintenance costs are also low.

The gullies are parallel and start around the middle of the slope. They extend by retreat of the gully heads upslope. Each gully is 2 to 4 m large and 1 to 2 m deep and up to 120 m long. Downslope, the gullies lose their depth and deposit fans composed of material eroded upstream, before they join the channel of Hannanet, which has the tendency to incise its bed (more than 4 m deep) inside colluvial deposits made of sand, clay and beds of pebbles. The plot was planted with shrubs of Atriplex halimus, and enclosed with a fence since April 2009. Planting was organised in strips 6 m apart, with the objective of stabilizing the gullies and restoring biodiversity. Planting density is about 760 shrubs\/ha, with a rate of success of about 89.5%. Owing to late plantation in spring it was irrigated every 20 days during the summer months. It is planned to open it again to grazing 2.5 years after its plantation.\nPurpose of the Technology: The objective of the fencing to prevent encroachment of animals is to improve the vegetation cover through reduction of loss through grazing and reduced compaction of the soil. This improves biodiversity and also provides richer and more varied grass fodder in addition to the fodder from the shrubs. The improved cover density retains water in the soil and reduces runoff. The aim is to reduce the catchment area of the gullies, and the amount of water collected in order to progressively diminish the gullies.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Several phases were undertaken in the establishment of this experimental plot: The plants were obtained from a nursery in the Beni Mellal region (from the Forest authority). The second activity was the preparation of holes (760 holes of 40x40x40cm) and the establishment of a wire fence around the plot, in order to ensure no grazing during the first 2 years. After planting the shrubs, irrigation was necessary for the first few months during the dry season.\nNatural \/ human environment: The climate is semi-arid with around 450 mm of rain annually. The topography consists of a plateau, incised by channels, with short tributaries extending into the Grou valley. The slope angle is between 10 and 50 %. The soils on the slope are often not developed. The thick colluvium, which is made of erodible reddish sand and clay, explains the depth and width of the gullies.

Gully erosion management is a practice aimed to rehabilitate and protect further development of gullies and change into productive land. It involves both runoff management and erosion control activities. Gully management and treatment is different at upstream catchment area, gully head and gully section. Proper land management practices and slope treatment measures such as terraces, infiltration ditches and grass or shrub hedgerows are taking place on upstream catchment of the gully in order to reduce the rate of surface runoff.  The excess runoff above the gully head is safely drained using cutoff drains into natural or properly vegetated waterways in order to reduce the surface water entering into the gully and protect the constructed physical and biological measures being washed away.  Before treating gully sections,  for the purpose of stability of structures and quick healing, the gully should be reshaped and planted with grass sod. Gully wall reshaping is cutting off steep slopes of active gully flanks in to gentle slope of minimum at 45% slope, up to two-third of the total depth of the gully and constructing small trenches along contours for re-vegetating slanted part of the gully walls and beds. If the gully is wide and has meandering nature with huge accumulation of runoff flowing down, it requires constructing of retaining walls, to protect displaced (not yet stabilized) soils and soil materials and the sidewalls of the reshaped gully. Stabilization of gully sections involves the use of structural and vegetative measures in the head, floor and side of the gully. The construction of physical structures inside the gully section is followed by establishment of biological measures.\nPurposes of gully erosion management are: 1) rehabilitate the land damaged due to gully erosion, 2) prevent further expansion and development of gully erosion, and 3) convert the land lost by gully erosion to productive land.\nGully erosion management begins with assessment and mapping of gully erosion that helps to have an overview of erosion, to document extent of damage, to identify the nature and causes of gully formation, and gives relevant information to design appropriate measures. At establishment stage, gully management requires: catchment treatment using different land treatment measures; runoff diversion by cutoff drain; and stabilization of gully sections by physical structures and vegetative measures. Stones for the construction of terraces, cutoff drains and waterways are required. Depending on the nature of gully and available material for construction, either stones, sand bags, brush woods, bamboo mat, gabion or concrete (sand, gravel and cement) are needed for constructing check-dams in a gully section. Different tree\/shrub seedlings, grass cuttings, and seedlings of fruit trees are required to reinforce and stabilize the gully sections. The respective labor requirement for stone collection, construction of retaining wall, and gully reshaping is 0.5m3\/person day, 5m\/person day, and 1m3\/person day. Approximately 0.25, 0.50, 0.50,  0.50 , and 1.0 m3\/person day is required to construct gabion, loose stone, arc weir, sand bag, and bamboo mat check-dams respectively. About 3.0 m\/person day is needed to construct brushwood check dams. The treated gullies should be checked regularly. The maintenance requirement is closely monitored and immediate repair is essential to avoid further damage and eventual collapse of structures. The inputs important for maintenance include stones or other materials for check dams, seedlings to replant areas covered with non-survived seedlings.\nGully erosion is prevalent in areas where excess runoff occurs in high rainfall areas associated with moderate to high erodible soils. It occurs in range of wet highland to moist Kolla areas where annual rainfall exceeds 900mm. Its occurrence is more frequent in heavy clay soils (Vertisols) characterized by low infiltration and in clay soils (like Nitosols) characterized by low organic matter. Often, gully formation occurs on overgrazed pasture lands and inappropriately managed crop lands. Gully erosion control requires mobilization of high input or materials and labor. Larger gullies need to be rehabilitated and treated through community labor mobilization. Subsequent maintenance activities, monitoring and benefit sharing should be made by the user groups who are entitled to utilize the benefits.\nThe living condition depends on subsistence crop-livestock mixed farming. On average households have 5-6 family size. Crop production is meant for home consumption with small surplus for local market. The services related to water supply, energy supply, and infrastructure are low. Besides it is an asset, animals often used to cope shocks during drought periods.COMMENTS:Livestock density (if relevant):\n\u003E 100 LU \/km2\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Land degradation due to different forms of soil erosion and nutrient depletion, overgrazing, shortage of pasture lands and its low productivity, excessive and inappropriate construction of traditional ditches, and increased pressure on trees for the purpose of fuel wood and timber.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Soil erosion and soil nutrient depletion, shortage of cultivated land, shortage of grazing land and wood for fuel wood\nThe type of grazing is often free grazing on communal grazing lands\/pasture, supplemented with crop residues and zero grazing combined with improved foragesSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices|Geospatial technologies|GIS|GPS","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1197, 1210, 1206, 1052, 1027, 1028","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|disaster management|Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|crop production","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 910, 914, 922, 918, 1154, 897, 1186, 899, 898","readiness_level":"7.

On top of the barrier a dense line of mikayeba (tree cassava: Manihot glaziovii) is planted. Trash continues to be added to the nowliving barrier until the gully is fully silted up.

Multiple gullies plugged in succession dissipate runoff energy, foster local water retention and infiltration, encourage sedimentation, assist in the stabilization of gully bed and side banks, and stimulate revegetation of flow paths; the channel measures must be combined with proper SLM in the catchments upstream.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Mira HaddadCharacteristics: Multiple gully plugs positioned sequentially within a gully system interrupt concentrated surface runoff and reduce its erosive power. The plugs are each made of multiple cobbles\/stones mostly ranging between 10 and 30 cm diameter and constructed to ensure a stable structure. The plugs started at the head of the gully (upstream) and ranges from 1.5 - 3.7 m in width with an average of 2.5 m. For heavily eroded and very unstable sections, gabions can be used also. The structures are around 1.0 to 1.5-m high, anchored into the sidewalls, and around 0.20 to 0.35 m deep into the gully bed, built up to around 1\/3 to max. 1\/2 of the gully depth - ensuring the concentrated flow stays within the channel and does not overflow the side banks. The top of the plug is U-shaped, with the sides built higher than the centre. Upslope, the plugs are packed with soil to trap sediments (stopping it flowing through the structure), and downslope the plugs have an apron to dissipate the energy of overflowing water, into a micro stilling basin. The downslope side of the gully plug is sloped rather than vertical. The large stones add roughness to the slope, creating a rough spillway that dissipates erosive energy. In the direction of gully flow, several gully plugs are placed such that the upper gully apron is set at approximately the height of the following downstream gully crest.\nEnvironment: The technology is used in a watershed close to Al Majeddyeh village, located in the Middle Badia zone, approximately 30 km south-east of Amman. The climate is arid and warm (Palmer, 2013). The average annual rainfall is around 130 mm. The natural environment is labelled as steppe, \u201cBSh\u201d in the k\u00f6ppen classification. The human environment is characterized by agropastoralists. They are semi-nomadic and live in villages around the watershed, for example, Al Majeddyeh village.\nPurpose: The measure interrupts the concentrated flow, reduces velocity, and dissipates energy. Multiple structures along the gully decrease the erosive power of runoff, retaining a fraction of the runoff, inducing sedimentation (upstream of the plug), thus protecting the gully bed from further deep-scouring, and strengthening the gully side banks, especially when this is linked with re-vegetation. Over time, the establishing vegetation (roots and surface cover) stabilizes the soil and protects it from concentrated flow erosion. To be effective, gully plug emplacement requires SLM in upland areas. These measures then jointly mitigate peak runoff generation and accordingly reduce downstream flooding.\nMajor activities: Upland SLM is essential. In the specific watershed rehabilitation context, upland SLM was achieved through micro water harvesting and re-vegetation through native shrubs (the \u201cVALLERANI\u201d method). Gully morphology assessment is required for gully plug design, and positioning and earthwork excavation is necessary for foundation preparation in the gully bed and wall anchors. Proper layering of various size stones and shaping of gully plugs is necessary as is the addition of a packed soil pack upstream of the stone structure, to semi-seal the surface and to pond water. Then gully walls are revegetated through native seedlings: these benefit from the water ponding upstream prior to sedimentation upstream of the gully and enhanced soil water storage in the sediments once the gully is filled.\nBenefits: Stops ongoing land degradation and gully deepening, and achieves a certain degree of rehabilitation; retains a fraction of runoff water and sediments in the watershed \u2013 water mainly infiltrates and provides moisture to the gully vegetation; gully vegetation serves various purposes including livestock fodder, reduction of flow velocities in the gully, and retention of further sediment.\nLand user\u0027s opinion: Land users benefit from the vegetation (e.g. fruit trees can potentially be out-planted), as well as ponded water for livestock; however, the technology is labor-intensive, and therefore costly, and landowners (at the local target site) require incentives to carry out the work.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|water use optimization for sustainability|Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|Farm management|disaster management","use_cases_id":"916, 918, 919, 921, 922, 920, 897, 1186, 899, 910, 1154","readiness_level":"7.

These small dams reduce the speed of water flow and minimise the erosive power of runoff. They also promote the deposition of eroded materials to further stabilise the gullies.\nTwo gullies adjacent to a degraded area of communal grazing land were controlled by constructing check dams and with vegetative measures including planting bamboo. The main purpose was to control the further development of the gullies, which were affecting the adjacent grazing land and blocking a downstream irrigation channel. The site is community land used by the 40 households (240 people) of Dhotra village in the intensively used Jhikhu Khola watershed. Irrigated cropland lies downstream from the site, whilst the site itself is bordered by grazing land, degraded sal-dominated forest, and rainfed forward-sloping terraces.\nThe check dams were made of old cement bags filed with soil and were 1m high with 0.5m deep foundations. The check dams were spaced so that a line joining the top of two adjacent dams had about a 3% slope gradient. Twenty-four check dams were built in the two gullies using a total of 2400 filled cement bags. Forty clumps of bamboo were planted between the dams for stabilisation.\nAll that is needed to maintain this technology is to inspect the condition of the check dams occasionally, especially before and after the monsoon.

The plantation of Spanish drok was introduced in 1972 for the first time in the research field station. Spanish drok is a perennial plant and has the ability of spreading fast through its roots and also via seeds. Most of the gullies are covered with Spanish drok by now. In total 150,000 seedlings were planted at the research station.\nPurpose of the Technology: Water erosion is highly threatening croplands by washing away the fertile topsoil. Severe gullies have formed on the hilly slopes. The research station of the soil institute therefore selected a number of gullies to test different techniques of rehabilitation.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: In a first step a survey of gullies in the vicinity of the research station was conducted in order to determine an appropriate place for testing the stabilization. Spanish drok was planted and spread very fast through vegetative underground reproduction until the whole gully was covered. A gabion made out of stone and concrete was constructed at the foot of the gully. It contains a pipe to allow for outflow of excess water. Maintenance of the technology is less cost efficient and doesn\u0027t involve much cost associated activities.\nNatural \/ human environment: The positive results of the implementation of this technology are very important as there is a great need for spreading it to other areas suffering from the same problems in Tajikistan. Spanish drok is generally not available in Tajikistan. Nowadays, the research station is providing seedlings for sale to interested farmers with a cost of roughly $ 0.40 per seedling.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): loss of arable land, development of gullies, water erosionSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|disaster management|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 910, 1154, 920, 918, 917","readiness_level":"9.

The end result is a stabilized gully that is prevented from advancing further. The system also involves fruit trees\/banana establishment and fodder grass planting for structure stabilization. Establishment of the technology involves excavation of pits, planting fruit trees\/bananas and grass cuttings.\nPurpose of the Technology: This is a structural measure that is vegetated for stabilization. Its purpose is to rehabilitate a gully bed, through control of concentrated runoff by reduction of slope length and both trapping of runoff and sediment harvesting. The productive use of the innovation is mainly for perennial crops (fruit trees and\nbananas) and for fodder production.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Earth check dams are constructed in the gully, using borrow spoil from square pits in the walls of the gully (see diagram). The earth embankment of the dams are then stabilized with grass. Pawpaws are planted on the original gully floor. Initially the innovator left the pits empty: now she plants bananas in them.The 5 check dams, each 1 m or more in height, are spaced at about 10 m apart in the gully. The excavated pits are about 1 m x 1 m wide and 1 m deep. Four pits are dug separately on each side of each check dam. Makarikari grass (Panicum coloratum var. makarikariensis) is used for stabilization, while bananas and pawpaws are planted within the rehabilitated area. When it rains, runoff generated from the neighbouring plots upstream flows down and is slowed by the check dams. The runoff passes around both wings of each embankment, filling and flowing through the pits. Sediment is trapped in the pits. Excess runoff flows on to the second embankment, then through the second set of pits and so on. Only during heavy rains does water pass through and out of the system, though its velocity is reduced. Thus the gully heals slowly with time and vegetation becomes established. Regular maintenance work is required, involving repair of broken sections from time to time, using manual labour with a panga, shovel and jembe. Also of importance is manure application every season to the planted areas before the rains to sustain fertility and thus productivity.\nNatural \/ human environment: Kalekye Mutua is a single household head in her mid thirties.

The gully floor is vegetated with different trees inter alia willow, poplar, cherry, blackberry and walnut which are arranged in random groups. At the bottom of the gully where it intersects the road there is a stonewall, which collects the sediments that are washed down during heavy rainfalls mostly in spring. A dense bush line with Russian olives, apricots, cherries, walnuts, plums and buxus has been planted on the top of the side slopes of the gully, and roots of those bushes keep the soil stable and at the same time they prevent landslides and expansion of the gully. These tree lines are cut from time to time,  otherwise they grow and become heavy and due to their weight the trees would possibly fall into the gully.\nPurpose of the Technology: (1) The deep roots of willow trees on the bottom of the gully protect the soil and prevent it from being eroded during the heavy spring floods. Trees also help to collect sediment and to accumulate it in the gully. (2) The dense bush lines with its deep roots, on the top of the gully slope, stop the horizontal erosion, which endangers the fertile orchard close to the gully. (3) A stonewall at the lower end of the gully collects sediments which have been washed down. Once in a while a heightening of the stonewall has to be done. The technology with its three measures prevents from further gully expansion and supports its rehabilitation.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: These three measures, the tree line, the bottom vegetation and the stonewall were developed and implemented by the farmer\u0027s own initiative. The farmer implemented the technology on his own and expands it every year. The entire technology doesn\u2019t have to be established at once, which allows investing money and time whenever it is available. For maintenance new trees are planted both in the gully and in the tree line, which has to be cut and pruned from time to time. The technology is relatively affordable and facile to implement. At the beginning the farmer bought some seedlings. Meanwhile, the plants reproduce themselves and the farmer doesn\u0027t have to buy seedlings for further maintenance. The stones can be collected for free in the nearby riverbed. The work is done manually; no special tools are needed for the technology.\nNatural \/ human environment: The farmer is proud of the outcome of his initiative. However he wishes that his neighbours would follow his lead, as for them it would be beneficial to implement the technology as well. He stated that usually people do not listen to a common farmer, but if the technology would be introduced by an official person it would spread out quickly.COMMENTS:Boundary points of the Technology area: northernmost: 38\u00b036\u002700.09\u0022\/69\u00b023\u002758.93\u0022\nsouthernmost: 38\u00b035\u002754.77\u0022\/69\u00b024\u002703.18\u0022\nComments:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.002138 m2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Highly erodible loess soil, and heavy rainfalls which causes a lot of surface runoff and erosion.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Lack of water for irrigation, too few rain, steep slopes, infertile soils which make the use of fertilizers essential.\nConstraints of wastelands \/ deserts \/ glaciers \/ swamps\nNumber of growing seasons per year:\n    1\nSpecify:\nLongest growing period in days: 210Longest growing period from month to month: March to AugustSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|Farm management|disaster management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 918, 910, 1154, 917, 922, 920","readiness_level":"9.

The Chokar watershed is a mountainous area situated between 600 m and 2,500 m above sea level. The climate is semi-arid with harsh and cold weather in winter and hot and dry summers. The annual precipitation in average years is 580 mm. Land degradation affects all forms of land use and includes sparse vegetation cover, severe topsoil erosion from water, and poor soil fertility. Unsustainable agricultural practices, together with over-exploitation and high pressure on the natural resources, are adversely impacting the socio-economic well-being of local communities, as well as contributing to the risk of being adversely affected by drought, and also leading to landslides and flash foods triggered by heavy rainfall. The data used for the documentation of the technology are based on field research conducted in Chokar watershed, namely in the villages of Sari Joy and Jawaz Khana. These villages represent the upper and the middle zone of Chokar watershed, respectively. They differ considerably in access to services and infrastructure, but in general are poorly served. The communities depend on land resources for sustaining their livelihoods. In a good year with high yields, wheat self-sufficiency lasts about 5 months. The villages are home to ethnic Qarluq communities. Since 2012 the Livelihood Improvement Project Takhar (LIPT) implemented by Terre des hommes (Tdh) Switzerland has initiated a range of NRM interventions. \nThe Livelihood Improvement Project in Takhar supported Natural Resources Management Committees to rehabilitate two gullies with check dams and trees in Sari Joy and Jawaz Khana. The check dams are made of stone walls built across the widest section of the gully. Jute bags filled with soil are used in the narrower sections of the gully to form a solid barrier for soil to accumulate. Tree seedlings and cuttings of Russian willow and acacia are planted between the check dams to stabilize the soil. During the first 2-3 years, the trees need to be protected from grazing, and from cutting for fuelwood. Watering of the trees may also be required during the dry season, especially in Jawaz Khana, to support their survival.  Such methods of gully rehabilitation are feasible in the area, since the construction and planting materials are locally available. However, the costs for establishing the check dams remain relatively high and the local villages have contributed mainly with labour inputs, while the costs for construction material were provided by the project. \nCheck dams inside the gully slow the water flow and help its infiltration into the soil. The structures also collect sediment and reduce further erosion of the gully bed, and prevent its expansion in the area.  Well managed check dams, after several years, can produce trees for fuelwood and grass for animal fodder. \nRehabilitation of gullies is an innovative practice for the local land users, but it is supported by the local communities for its  visible impact on preventing further erosion and loss of community land used for crop cultivation, forest and orchards. After taking part in the design and implementation of rehabilitation activities, the local land users expressed that they had acquired useful skills and will be able to conduct these works independently if the material resources are available.\nWomen support the work by preparing and bringing food to the workers in the field. Women are also occasionally involved in filling the jute bags with soil and bring the bags to the gully. This requires significant inputs, bearing in mind that gullies are often formed in very steep areas where there are no roads - and thus the food and other material can be delivered only by foot or with a donkey.COMMENTS:This documentation is based on the experiences of SLM implementers from Sari Joy (1 treated gully) and Jawaz Khana (1 treated gully).SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|Farm management|disaster management|field management|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Production|crop production|Access to knowledge and advisory|agricultural skills development","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 918, 910, 1154, 914, 922, 917, 897, 898, 965, 968","readiness_level":"7.

If stabilization measures are not implemented, gullies will persist in eroding deeper through regressive erosion or sidewall subsidence, eventually becoming very deep in fragile sedimentary soils. It is much easier and more economical to carry out repair work in the early stages of newly formed gullies. Large, uncontrolled gullies are difficult and costly to repair. Gully treatment is achieved through reducing runoff speed, thus preventing linear soil erosion and the loss of productive land.\nDry stone check dams are well suited to small gullies up to 2 m wide and 1 m deep, with a gentle to medium slope and a medium-soft to hard substrate, and are recommended for cultivated land, reforestation areas, rangelands, etc. But these structures are not suitable for larger gullies, with steep slopes and a very fragile substrate. \nThe height of each stone check dam depends on local conditions but should never exceed 1.50 m in height. The length depends on the gully\u0027s cross-section (width and shape). A check dam\u2019s width should vary according to the volume of water passing through the gully. Wings of stone (higher than the centre point of the check dam) should be securely anchored into gully banks to enhance rigidity and stability and to prevent water flowing around the check dam and creating new gullies to either side.\nThe purpose of check dams is to slow down water velocity, dissipate its energy, prevent erosion, and induce sedimentation upstream. This process helps reduce the gully slope and facilitates re-vegetation. In the case of deep gullies with filled check dams upstream, another series of check dams can be built to create a stable parabolic section for water passage and re-vegetation with protective species.\nThis technology makes it possible to control gullying, encourage infiltration and conserve soil moisture, while contributing to groundwater recharge and land reclamation.\nThe main activities involved in gully treatment are as follows:\n\u2022Designing the structure;\n\u2022Marking contour lines perpendicular to the gully using a watertube level or an A-Frame;\n\u2022Determining the size of spillway (area of origin and estimated volume of runoff);\n\u2022Determining the height of the gully and the width of the section to be treated (equal to 2 or 3 times the height of the gully);\n\u2022Building the structures;\n\u2022Excavating the anchoring trench: dig down to a depth of 10 to 20 cm over the width of the section to be treated (the earth resulting from the excavation is deposited upstream);\n\u2022Building the check dam, starting with a layer of gravel, followed by large stones at the bottom, then progressively medium-sized stones and finally small rubble stones;\n\u2022Building wings at the sides of the check dams, following the contour line and using small stones and earth-filled sacks.\nThe inputs needed to implement this technology are soil, stones, gravel and rubble, as well as wheelbarrows, pickaxes, pegs, etc. Experienced manpower is required and access to a vehicle may be needed to transport the inputs.\nThe technology is suitable for all types of soil and landforms, easy to build and inexpensive, but only if stone is readily available. In addition, it has an immediate impact on the evolution of the gully, correcting the slope and helping reduce flow velocity, thereby controlling the gullying process. It promotes infiltration, conserves soil moisture, contributes to groundwater recharge and reclaims land (especially gully slopes for useful vegetation such as bamboo, vetiver or fodder grasses). It requires maintenance at the start of the rainy season and regular visits to check that it is working properly.\nFarmers claim that this technology significantly increases their crop yields through water infiltration and groundwater recovery. However, they acknowledge the substantial financial and human resources required for gully treatment, emphasizing the need for support from development partners for its widespread adoption.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|disaster management","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 918, 920, 910, 914, 897, 898, 1154","readiness_level":"9.

It involves manually excavating trenches 3 to 3.5 m long and 0.6 m deep, spaced 4 m apart in staggered rows. This results in around 625 trenches per hectare. The excavated earth is piled downhill of the trenches, which are aligned perpendicular to the slope. In the middle of each trench, a 0.40 m high step is left on which the tree seedling is planted. The tree receives the water it needs from the trench where it collects.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of this technique is to restore tree cover on degraded, unfertile land and prevent water erosion on slopes by reducing the flow of water that threatens land downstream. The trenches reduce gully erosion and pedimentation of areas with a fragile soil structure. Like all afforestation measures, in the medium term, this technique is effective in protecting the land against water and wind erosion. The shade provided by the trees also lowers the temperature of the soil and the infiltration of water in the hand-dug trenches contributes to groundwater recharge.\nAreas restored using hand-dug trenches can subsequently be exploited to a limited extent in accordance with strict controls.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The technique is very labour intensive. Work must begin immediately after harvesting when the soil is still moist and workable. A protection and monitoring system is required to ensure that grazing animals do not damage the young trees. The mortality of trees after planting is relatively high (survival rate is about 60%), and dead trees must be replaced systematically during the first three years. Good community organisation is required.\nNatural \/ human environment: Hand-dug trenches are particularly useful when rainfall is low, as they retain water and make it available to the trees growing in them. In years when rainfall is abundant or there are violent downpours, the young trees are protected, as they are planted on a raised step within the trench, although there is a risk of flooding in the event of very heavy rain.COMMENTS:major cash crop: Ground nut\nmajor food crop: Millet\nother: Sorghum, cow peas and mangoes\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): water erosion (gully, sheet), wind erosion, degraded and infertile land\nNomadism: Yes\nSemi-nomadism \/ pastoralism: Yes\nCut-and-carry\/ zero grazing: Yes\nImproved pasture: Yes\nMixed: (eg agro-pastoralism, silvo-pastoralism): Yes\nOther grazingland: agropastoralism\nSelective felling of (semi-) natural forests: Yes\nForest products and services: timber, fuelwood, fruits and nuts, grazing \/ browsing, other forest products \/ uses (honey, medical, etc.)\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: armers are mainly agropastoralists with some communities specialised on pure pastoralism\nConstraints of common grazing land\nConstraints of forested government-owned land or commons\nLivestock density: 1-10 LU \/km2SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|forestry management|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 927, 921, 920, 918, 919, 897, 1186, 899, 922","readiness_level":"7.

Diese starken Niederschl\u00e4ge ereignen sich meist im Sommer w\u00e4hrend Gewittern. Um das Risiko weiterer Erosion und Folgesch\u00e4den auf Nachbarparzellen und Strassen zu minimieren, entschied sich der Bauer, einen Teil des Feldes als Ackersaum zu nutzen, um so die Neigung und Hangl\u00e4nge zu verringern.

These hedgerows are a soil conservation measure but they also help to generate additional biomass and fodder and\/or income for marginal farmers; in addition, they offer the added benefit of helping to balance the ecosystem and to address climate change by encouraging biodiversity. This improved version of a local technology makes maximum use of indigenous knowledge and adds to it by making available the latest scientific knowledge.\nPurpose of the Technology: Farmers have traditionally selected plants for hedgerow cultivation based on practical considerations such as the availability of seeds and seedlings, how well seeds germinate, how well the plants grow and how well they can be coppiced, their branching habit, the amount of biomass they can produce, and how much cash the crop can generate. They made these choices without the benefit of any external input or scientific knowledge, relying solely on what they have been able to observe locally over the years. The participatory technology development process aims to help farmers by providing them with scientific input to augment their traditional knowledge on the selection, plan, and design of hedgerows. Over a very short time, the farmers learn to make good use of the new information and start enjoying the benefits that the improved agriculture yields in terms of social, economic, and environmental benefits.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The following steps outline how hedgerows can be established on sloping land:\n\u2022 A participatory designing and planning process is used to choose which sloping lands will be cultivated and to select which hedgerow species are to be planted.

Plots that had previously been farmed by the method of shifting cultivation, where plots are allowed to lie fallow for a number of years, are now cultivated annually. This land use change is worrying because shifting cultivation has traditionally been practised in areas where the quality of the soil is poor and cannot support annual crop production year on year.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Institutional|Capacity development function|Farmer field schools|Knowledge management function|Research and education function|Integration of traditional and scientific knowledge|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1116, 1126, 1125, 1123, 1132, 1134, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 917, 918, 919, 897, 898, 910, 1180, 914, 915, 909","readiness_level":"7.

Improved soil structure, and deep and dense root systems in the hedgerow area result in slowing runoff from adjacent land, increasing infiltration rates and capturing sediment. These factors reduce water erosion and nutrient leaching. On steep slopes or embankments, deep roots can prevent wet soils from slipping. Additionally, hedges can acts as windbreaks and thus reduce wind erosion of light soils: simultaneously soil particles in the air are filtered out by hedges. Hedgerows provide a habitat for various wild animals for their food, reproduction, shelter and retreat. The hedge can act as a measure for natural pest control: for example as a habitat for raptors that control voles. A well-placed hedge may improve the microclimate of a field by reducing wind speed and increasing soil moisture in the wind-protected area.\nAn effective hedge must be strategically sited and carefully established. The optimal hedge is a multi-row hedgerow (at least three rows) with a herbaceous border on both sides. The width of the hedge should be, ideally, 5-6 m (LfULG, 2014). Hedges are best planted parallel to the contour line, along the direction of cultivation, not on the headland, and should be sited a minimum of 20 m from the nearest road. Preparing a planting plan is very important for the establishment of a hedge. It should be based on native species (K\u00fchne et al., 2018). Planting is usually done from October to November. Since a newly planted hedge requires regular costly watering (100 litres for trees, 20 litres for shrubs) spring planting is not advisable.\nMaintenance pruning can be divided into hard pruning (every 10-15 years) and pruning for shape and maintenance (every year). Hedges that are not maintained will lack fruit, develop deadwood, or simply die back. Maintenance pruning should be done in February or March when there is no frost and before the plants sprout. A clean, smooth cut is important to prevent fungi or diseases from entering the plants. Hard pruning of hedges means cutting shrubs to a height of a few centimetres. As a general rule, a hedge should be divided into at least three sections, which should be hard pruned in succession. In this way, the hedge always retains a flowering and a fruiting element. Individual trees should be left as shelter\/seed trees. The annual maintenance cuts should be used to shape the hedge, but also to remove broken or diseased branches (NABU Niedersachsen).\nHedgerows also have drawbacks for farmers and landowners. They take up cropland, which initially reduces yields. Once established, they cannot be easily removed, limiting management flexibility. It is uncertain whether hedges will be eligible for financial support or whether they will remain eligible after several years. For example, a hedge in Germany that is initially eligible for financial support must prove, after 10 years, that all the required species are still part of the hedge. If not, the money received from the subsidy must be repaid. Moreover, maintenance requires a lot of work, which needs to be compensated by subsidies (Th\u00fcnen, 2021).COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Native species utilization|Species diversification","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1201, 1200","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 919, 921, 920, 910, 914, 897, 898, 915, 922","readiness_level":"7.

Provides resilient forage that improves soil health and provides a habitat for biodiversity within a rotational grazing system\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Alan RadbournePerridge and Old Burford Farm is a 182 ha organic dairy and beef farm in Somerset. They established 43 ha of diverse herbal leys on their grazing platform between 2018 and spring 2021. There are a further 16 ha to be sown in autumn 2021 with further developments planned thereafter. \nThe system initially established a mix of chicory, plantain, ryegrass and clover in Autumn 2018, with further fields including a more complex mix of cocksfoot, Festulolium sp (a natural hybrid of ryegrass and fescue) , ryegrass, timothy, tall and meadow fescue, sainfoin; red, white, alsike and sweet clovers, sainfoin, lucerne, birdsfoot trefoil, burnet, chicory, ribgrass forage herb, yarrow and sheep\u2019s parsley.\nThe most successful establishment has been from autumn sowing, following ryegrass, into a well prepared seed bed with shallow cultivation. This has led to three to four times more effective germination. To prepare the seed bed, a Cambridge roller was used to form a firm seed-bed and stop seeds going too deep, then seed was sown using a grass harrow and air seeder in August. Soil was rolled again with the Cambridge roller to break up clods of soil and then given a flat-roll to give tight soil-to-seed contact and to conserve moisture. The field is then left untouched until the following spring.\nOnce established by the following spring, the leys are grazed with 140 organic dairy cows, calves and beef animals. They are grazed using a strip rotation approach where they are moved daily at a target of 4,000kg dry matter (DM)\/ha, and graze the herbage down to a residual of 1,800kg DM\/ha (minimum residual of 10cm). The minimum full rotation is 35 days but this is often longer. \nNo artificial inputs are used with these diverse herbal leys, thus adhering to organic standards. The legumes (clover, lucerne, sainfoin and birdsfoot trefoil) are used to fix nitrogen, and with the grazing approach of \u201ca third eaten, a third trampled and a third remaining as residual feed\u201d soil organic matter is built up. In addition, the deep rooting species draw up minerals, improve soil structure and infiltration, and increase soil organic matter (SOM). Increasing SOM can also increase soil bacteria and microbe activity. Furthermore, managing the system with a rotational, cell grazing approach prevents selective grazing and increases species diversity and longevity of the sward.\nBenefits:\nSoil health \u2013 deep rooting species improve soil structure and infiltration, and through building up organic matter this improves soil carbon sequestration and leads to greater soil microbial activity and improved nutrient cycling. This is particularly important for this site due to mineral deficiency.\nResilient and persistent forage \u2013 deep rooting species bring up moisture from deep in the soil.\nMineral-rich forage \u2013 there is a high mineral content in ribwort plantain, chicory, sheep\u2019s parsley, yarrow and burnet. Again, root structure helps, mining more minerals from deeper in the soil profile.\nBiodiversity improvements - a wider species diversity of flowing plants is beneficial for biodiversity.\nAnimal health benefits \u2013 Anthelmintic properties of some species with a high tannin content, such as chicory, sainfoin and birdsfoot trefoil, reduce the parasitic worm burden. Also, the way livestock are grazed, with a good residual of forage, reduces soil contact and, therefore, worm risk\nThere are many positives to herbal leys and these have all been experienced to date, particularly resilient forage production in dry conditions. It currently is too early to see changes in soil structure and health.\nThe challenge with herbal leys are ensuring successful establishment and selecting the right seed mix. Establishment is reliant on conditions and preparations, with the lifespan of the ley managed through careful grazing by having long rotations and preventing selective grazing. Ensuring you have the correct mix of grasses, herbs and legumes to get the balance of energy and protein is key: there has been some anecdotal experience at this farm of cows not seeming \u201cfull\u201d coming off herbal ley, this is thought due to dominance of chicory over grasses.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1197, 1200, 1206, 1199","use_cases":"Production|animal production|Farm management|field management|livestock monitoring|animal health|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|optimization of resource use for better production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 910, 914, 905, 907, 916, 917, 921, 922, 918, 919, 909, 915","readiness_level":"7.

In this case, afforestation at high altitudes, which is particularly challenging, with the primary purpose of erosion control were planted in small patches with different methods. They form the basis for future community forests in Armenia.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Hanns KirchmeirForests are - in terms of biomass accumulation and stability - the most successful ecosystems in the world. Natural forest ecosystems offer multiple ecosystem services, such as timber and fuel wood provision, water purification, carbon sequestration. In mountainous landscapes, forests have an additional protective function against erosion and natural hazards (e.g., avalanches, landslides, debris flows or rock falls). In the South Caucasus, two natural limits restrict forest expansion: at 2.300-2.600m a.s.l. the upper tree line is visible, whereas steppe and semi-desert ecosystems form the lower tree line.\nSocio-economic and geo-physical living conditions:\nThe intervention area is located at the northern to eastern slopes of Mount Aragats (4013m). The villages are located at 1600 to 1800 m above sea level where the slope meets a plain with stepic soils and crop production while the slopes of the mountains are used for livestock grazing (sheep and cattle).\nPurpose of afforestation:\nBy means of afforestation of degraded pastures, mountainous areas that suffer from erosion and overgrazing should be rehabilitated and erosion protection capacity enhanced. At the same time, the afforestation sites should form the basis for future community forests providing a wide range of ecosystem services, a concept that has not yet been established in Armenia.\nImplementation\nBetween 2014 and 2017 more than 200 hectares were fenced for afforestation, 145 ha were actively afforested in 10 different communities around Mount Aragats in Armenia. The average size of the 20 plots is 10 ha (35 ha being the largest site, 1 ha the smallest one).\nThe afforestation included different species combinations, planting schemes and methods to determine most cost-efficient afforestation methods for Armenian conditions. All afforestation took place at elevations between 1900 and 2300 m.a.s.l.. The afforestation included fencing of the area to protect the afforestation site against grazing, the preparation of the planting sites according to fixed planting schemes, the actual planting in lines with trenches, single plant holes and group plantings. For some sites, additional irrigation was established for the first years. Particular attention was paid to the species selection which explicitly included fruit trees and shrubs to ensure local economic returns. \nPractical experiences\nA wide range species was tested. Within the given climate context, pine (Pinus sylvestris), the main non-native species as well as native maple (Acer trautvetteri), Persian Oak (Quercus macranthera) and birch (Betula litwinowii) showed the best results. Particular attention was paid to adapted species to create resilient forest-shrubland with a large number of tree species. In general, planting in trenches shows highest survival rates. Bare root system and containerized seedlings were used for planting. Containerized seedlings definitely provide better survival rate in comparison with bare root system seedlings.  Additionally, mulch cover was provided to protect seedlings and keep soil humidity. The main maintenance measures are repeated mulching and weed control and irrigation during the first 3 years. Furthermore, some replanting is continuously taking place as the sites are facing tough environmental conditions (hot summers, drought, short vegetation period).\nThe plantation was organised and supervised by local NGO\u0027s (ATP Armenian Tree Project, ESAC Environmental Sustainability Assistance Center) in close cooperation with the local village population. In a Memorandum of Understandig between the Armenian Ministry of Territorial Administration and Development, the local village administration and  GIZ the share of payed labour and own contribution was fixed beforehand.\nImpacts and perception\nAfter the first years already first successes are becoming visible contributing to increased vegetation cover, increased biomass and improved soil protection. The communities are proud to be amongst the first in Armenia with a community forest. However, slow growth will require continuous commitment and care on behalf of the community.COMMENTS:Differerent small afforestation plots between 1 and 30 ha with a total of approximately 200 haSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Native species utilization|Species diversification","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1201, 1200","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|Farm management|disaster management|Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|crop production","use_cases_id":"916, 927, 917, 919, 922, 921, 918, 910, 1154, 897, 899, 1186, 898","readiness_level":"7.

This \u201ccompact settlement development\u201d makes the most efficient use of space. Simultaneously it contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the maintenance of farmland or forest areas on the outskirts of urban areas. One example is the rehabilitation and utilization of \u201cbrownfields\u201d, including previous industrial areas. Another example is redevelopment of transportation infrastructure within settlements or on the urban fringe. However, the revitalization and utilization of brownfields is often expensive. Other aspects of inner urban development are the reuse of vacant lots, the use of spaces between buildings and the improvement of existing building structures by adding extra floors.\nPurpose of the Technology: Through these developments, the rate of daily land consumption by settlement and transportation can be reduced. In Germany, such land loss reached 73 ha\/day in 2010. According to a survey commissioned by the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning, 20% of existing brownfields and vacant lots can be brought into use in the short term and  another 50% of the total in the long term: 30% cannot be developed for various reasons including disputed tenure. The ambitious aim of the sustainability strategy of the German federal government is to reduce today\u2019s daily land consumption for settlement and transport from the current 73 ha\/day to 30 ha\/day by 2020. However this appears unrealistic: nevertheless with high-quality inner urban development technology, this could be achieved by 2030. If the technology is planned and implemented through scenario simulation of sectoral land use changes in Germany (agriculture, forest and settlements), then calculations show that the daily land loss by settlement and transport could be reduced from 45 ha\/day in a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d scenario (with some improvements assumed) to 30 ha\/per day in 2030 by using high-quality inner urban development measures.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: During re-densification of urban areas sufficient green spaces must be protected to address climate change considerations such as higher temperatures and more runoff. High urban densities lead to an increase in the \u201cheat island effect\u201d (a combination of extensive urban\/ suburban landscapes with reduced air circulation, little cloud cover and long periods of high temperature). Thus, the rehabilitation of brownfields has to go along with the transformation of impervious surfaces into permeable ones, and planning of corridors for air exchange by \u201cgreen and blue climate corridors\u201d (public parks, ponds and rivers). There are several initiatives to establish high quality inner urban development in Germany. These include: 1) \u201cInner before external\u201d urban development within the Federal Building Law; 2) Many communities operating a brownfields and vacant lots cadastre; 3) General management of urban areas. Nevertheless, the reuse of inner city brownfields often requires considerable and costly remediation of contaminated sites. Due to the ownership issues of vacant lots, many are not easily accessible through municipalities, and this complicates their development. In other cases, available construction areas or buildings are not appropriate to the needs of investors.COMMENTS:Boundary points of the Technology area: 51.075063; 7.335960\n51.164380; 7.251345\n51.107561; 6.988673\n50.816401; 7.674266\n50.585640; 6.892780\n50.793044; 6.867394\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 1590 km2.\nTechnology is the result of a scenario simulation fow whole Germany but is mapped in the Rhine region as an example.The technology does not document a specific inner urban development project and the region mapped is an example.

Bukal, Nagcarlan, Laguna situated in the area of Mt. Banahaw. The area with rolling to hilly terrain is receiving an annual  rainfall of 1000-2000 mm. Each of the farmers who practiced the technology has 0.5 to 1.0 ha production area. Moreover, the community is accessible to infrastructures such as schools and market. Soils in the area is relatively good for agriculture cultivation.\nKakawate, a small to medium-sized, thornless tree which usually attains a height of 10-12 m is being used as live trellis or \u0022balag\u0022 to various annual crops such as tomato, cucumber, chayote, beans, and ampalaya in the community. The cropping system is highly diversified since crop rotation is being practiced throughout the year. Aside from being an anchorage for annual crops, kakawate also stabilizes sloping lands and reduces soil erosion due to its strong roots which can grow 3-5 meters laterally, thereby holding the soil firmly.  They are planted in a row of  approximately 2-3 meters making it more effective in preventing soil erosion. Furthermore, kakawate is being trimmed and maintained  every 3-6 months or as needs arise to a approximate 3 meters high as live trellis, the trimmed leaves are very rich in nitrogen and will eventually serve as compost or crop cover. These will help in improving soil quality and moisture in the soil. In addition, kakawate has multiple uses and benefits; they can serve as hardwood or firewood when matured, as materials in making furniture and anchorage for flowering plants like orchids. \nIn establishing the live trellis system, kakawate trunks\/or cuttings \u0022quick sticks\u0022  with at least 2-meter height are planted in a row. An estimate of 0.5 to 1 meter planting distance within a row and also between rows is used.  When the kakawate trunks are already set up and planted, they are interconnected using a metallic wires. Along these wires, plastic straws are tied in a vertical position whereby crops can utilize this straws for creeping\/ climbing . Finally, the desired crop will be planted according to their cropping pattern. Maintenance of the technology includes: weeding and trimming. During infestation, application of pesticide is done but in minimal.\nThe technology requires manual works resulting to elimination of machines that contributes to soil compaction.\nThe technology has been a practice in the community for a long time, and land users continue to adopt the technology because of it\u0027s easiness and inexpensiveness to establish, and low cost in terms of maintenance activity. Adding up to this is the variety of plants to be grown, making their market more profitable. \nGliricidia normally grows in tropical countries like the Philippines and is being utilized as hedgerows for erosion control measures. Over the years, its effectiveness as erosion control is known, and  an increasingly used forage crop in cut-and-carry systems.COMMENTS:Most of the farmers in the community adopt the technologyMain crops (cash and food crops): Sayote, beans, tomato, cabbage, lettuce, KakawateSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|minimize pesticide use|Farm management|field management|climate change adaptation|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 921, 926, 910, 914, 918, 1180","readiness_level":"9.

The purpose of this technology is to obtain various products, generate a household income especially from the lemon trees as it is a long-term crop which provides a continuous supply of daily produce and is also relatively easy to grow, as well as to establish a comfortable environment for people to live in.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Be GechkimA home garden is the practice of planting different crops around the house such as a variety of vegetables, herbs, fruit trees, and other annual crops for the family\u2019s daily consumption as well as for commercial purposes. Home gardens have been set up in Cambodia and in many countries all over the world, albeit they might be named differently (Helen Keller International\/Cambodia., 2003). This technique provides both economic and environmental benefits: generating household incomes and regulating the micro-climate by creating a desirable and ambient temperature around the house which makes the lives of family members more comfortable. More importantly, the technology provides opportunities for marginal groups like women, children, aging people and the disabled, to carry out agricultural work that contributes to an increase in household income (Landon-Lane C., 2012; Helen Keller International, 2010).\nHome garden technique is being applied at Samraong village, Sambour commune, Sambour district, Kratie province, where the farmer is growing pomelo (30 trees) and lemon (10 trees) as the main crops for sale and other supplementary crops (banana, pineapple, pomegranate, lemongrass, coconut, mango and jackfruit mainly for household consumption. The technology is being implemented in an area of 1500 square meters (30x50 meters), with the Mekong River being located behind the house.\nIn order to plant the pomelo and lemon trees, the farmer digs  0.6 x 0.6 meter square pits that are 0.5 meters in depth. There is a distance of three meters from one pit to another to allow ample space for the trees to fully spread their branches. Animal manure is also added into the bottom of the pits. In addition, the farmer builds a small circular dike around the trunk of each pomelo and lemon tree in order to avoid water run-off while watering, and furthermore this can retain some water during rainfall. This technology only applies cattle and chicken manure, and avoids the use of chemical fertilizers.\nThrough the implementation of the home garden technology involving the cultivation of lemon and pomelo trees as the main produce as well as other supplementary crops, the farmer can gain many benefits. These include improving the farmer\u2019s daily income, creating greenery around the house and providing a favorable living environment that can adapt to the rising temperature caused by climate change. Also the technology is preventing or addressing soil erosion, and providing an appropriate environment for poultry raising. This technology is not expensive as the farmers are able to start implementing it on a step by step basis depending on the availability of labor and resources or they are also able to do it during their spare time.\nFarmers can harvest lemons on a daily basis (around 10 to 15 kg per day) and also other supplementary crops. The pomelo trees produce fruit once per year (around 30 fruits per tree on average). In addition, such crop diversification also creates a natural habitat for biodiversity underground, which is an important factor in enhancing soil nutrients and other aggregates. It also avoids the use of chemicals that could harm the health of the family.COMMENTS:Pomelo and lemon which can be harvested from the 3rd year and continue for about 15 years.\nLivestock density: 20 chickens, cage size 3 x 5 = 15 square metersSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1200, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|animal production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|optimization of resource use for better production|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 914, 916, 917, 918, 921, 899, 915, 909, 926","readiness_level":"7.

It allows involving  watering of home gardens during periods of unreliable rainfall.  To implement this technology, the land user was first trained by the International Institute for Rural Reconstruction ( IIRR ) which provided the initial training to farmers as part of a campaign  to promote adaptation to climate change. \n50 to 100 liters tanks with taps were placed on a raised platforms. Perforated plastic tubes allow water to flow and drip irrigate vegetable patches.  \nA water source is needed in order for the irrigation processes to take place. Hence water is pumped by a tredle pump into the plastic tanks. Perforated plastic tubes help to direct water to the gardens grown within the land users plots. In terms of maintenance, the water tank should be cleaned every month so that only uncontaminated water is used for irrigation purposes.  Home gardening can be carried out throughout the year if there is enough water available. \nWith this technology, the most significant costs occur during the establishment phase for the procurement of water tanks. Important to note with this technology as testified by the land user, is that  the high cost of water is the most important factor during the hot and dry season while maintenance costs are low once established in the medium and long term thus making the technology good for scaling.COMMENTS:The GPS point shows the technology site.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|Production|crop production|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management","use_cases_id":"916, 918, 897, 898, 920, 910, 914","readiness_level":"7.

Usually, a mixture of several crops that may include vegetables, fruits, plantation crops, spices, herbs, ornamental and medicinal plants as well as livestock that can serve as a supplementary source of food and income. Home gardens are a cropping system composed of soil, crops, weeds, pathogens and insects that convert resource inputs - solar energy, water, nutrients, labor, etc. - into food, feed, fuel, fiber and pharmaceuticals. Home gardens are important ways to ensure that the low-income households have access to the all the basic livelihood needs throughout the year. This is a resilience technology for resource-constrained farmers in remote parts of the world. During the wet season, farmers plant additional crops mainly vegetables to utilize the lower-storey niches because such crops are more shade tolerant. The multi-species and multi-canopy structure of the farming systems ensures stability against climate extremes such as drought, strong winds and dry spells.\nThe main features that characterize a home garden are (1) located near the residence; (2) containing a high diversity of plants; (3) production is supplemental rather than a main source of family consumption and income; (4) occupying a small area (~3 acres) and (5) requiring very low external inputs, relying mainly on recycling of crop residues and cow dung and seed from previous season\u2019s harvest.\nHome gardens play the role of producing subsistence items and generating additional income for the household. They are known for their stable yields, very varied products, continuous or repeated harvests during the year and low inputs. Whereas home gardens may not be the major sources of livelihood, they are known to contribute 10-35 percent of livelihoods of farmers and their productivity is reported to be up to 20 times that of other land uses such as irrigated fields, rise fields and fish ponds. home gardens are also an important source of nutrients providing approximately 10, 12, 150, 16, 31, 25 and 113 percent of the minimum daily requirement of protein, calcium, carotene, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and ascorbic acid, respectively.\nA large proportion of the products of home gardens is consumed by farmer families especially due to the remoteness of the area where a market economy has not yet developed. Home gardens also play sociol-cultural functions and provide products for religious rituals and ceremonies. The aesthetic role of home gardens is also considered important especially during the dry season when people spend evenings out in the garden. Hence, paying attention solely to the tangible economic and nutritional gains of home gardens, and agroforestry in general misses the various intangible ecological and social values.COMMENTS:Coordinates of only one location are indicated but there were several sites with home gardens.All elements of agroforoestry are present in the home gardensSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Species diversification|Integrated management systems|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206, 1200, 1197, 1198, 1203","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Supply chain management|support to consumption and nutrition|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 918, 917, 939, 944, 921, 915","readiness_level":"9.
