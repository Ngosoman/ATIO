Children are crammed into a factory model that fails to prepare them for jobs that are yet to exist. To break this vicious cycle with a human-centric approach, Alokito Hridoy wanted to be more aware of how, where and who they piloted their first intervention with. They\u00a0selected the children of factory workers in Tangail, Mirzapur, as their sample population and started conducting research to understand them better through a number of focused group discussions, home visits and interviews. Despite being blue-collar workers, the factory workers dreamed of prestigious, white-collar jobs for their children. To advance their dreams, Alokito Hridoy launched a low cost charter school 50 kilometers away from Dhaka in Tangail, Mirzapur. They\u00a0started gathering evidence in the school to gradually address the problems in the education system. They came up with one solution after another to provide education that is relevant for now and the future. Gradually, they came up with an education model rooted in empathy, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving. They are\u00a0improving the quality of education by preparing children with social, moral, emotional and cognitive skills to be adaptive, proactive and innovative problem solvers. The learning style is inquiry based: learning by playing, problem solving and inquiring. The initiative started the school with 100 students in Tangail, Mirzapur, about 50 kilometers north of Dhaka. The first year they educated students up to grade 3, all children of industrial workers. They are now educating 200 children up to grade 7 - their goal is to grow with the students and add a new grade each year. The school has a nominal fee, which adds a sense of accountability to the community and parents. A portion of Home Junctions sales, a retail outlet for home goods, goes to support Alokito Hridoy School. Alokito Hridoy knew from the start that a building is not the heart of a school, but rather it is the teachers. Hence they hire local teachers since they are the most knowledgeable about the area and the context. Teachers have an impact on students when they connect with them and are interested to learn more about them. Alokito Hridoy invest heavily in teacher training to nurture and empower them as the empathetic, 21st century facilitators and the catalyst of change in the school and community.\u00a0The teacher training approaches have expanded beyond the walls of Alokito Hridoy. They have partnered with the government, non-government and private schools to work on teacher development in primary and secondary education. Their training modules are designed for Bangla, English, Madrasah medium schools across the country and has the potential to bridge these silos with the hope of ensuring access to quality education for all.\n","type":"Institutional|Capacity development function|Agricultural vocational training centers|Farmer business schools|Farmer field schools|Knowledge management function|Partnerships|Research and education function|Social and socio-economic","type_id":"1116, 1126, 1127, 1128, 1125, 1123, 1135, 1132, 1076","use_cases":"Access to knowledge and advisory|agricultural skills development|access to agricultural advice|Business models support|supporting \/ implementing innovative business models|Collective action and aggregation|cooperative management to improve efficiency and governance","use_cases_id":"965, 968, 967, 969, 970, 973, 974","readiness_level":"7.

In this connection with this, she had been asking herself a crucial question: Who benefits from science? She was thinking about \u201c\u2026the development of research at the service of the community, seeking particularly a sociotechnical transformation of people and of the relationship between people and devices.\u201d With this concern in mind, she came across an open call that caught her attention: a German Institute was offering to fund the installation of biodigesters, as long as they were used to solve a specific environmental problem and, in turn, promoted community organization processes to ensure their sustainability. There, she saw an opportunity.\nThe urban-rural fringe of the towns of the province of Buenos Aires is made up of small communities where there are facilities for the production of poultry, pigs, feedlots, and dairy, taking advantage of the public utilities and labor of the area. Although the growth and development of these activities are essential for local economies, they produce a large amount of livestock waste that causes pollution; waste that could be used to generate biogas, a fuel naturally produced in the biodegradation process of organic matter.\u00a0\nWith great expectation, Mercedes approached the municipality of Balcarce to talk about the call. In that meeting, working in Los Pinos became a possibility. This community is made up of 350 inhabitants and a set of scattered houses mixing, within the urban fabric, with small plots for animal husbandry (pigs and poultry, mainly) that, in some cases, represent inhabitants\u2019 main means of livelihood. Residents of Los Pinos had been reporting different problems linked to the large amounts of accumulated livestock waste that caused, among other issues, a high presence of flies and strong odors. The situation reached a point where people could not take part in social and community activities as normal. Moreover, residents experienced frequent power outages that reduced access to water and did not have a natural gas network, forcing them to rely on gas cylinders or firewood for cooking, and heating their hom es. Hence, the biodigester represented a response to a comprehensive problem by addressing waste management and providing the community with a renewable energy source to extract water and reduce the chances of outages.\u00a0\nMercedes formed a group with other researchers from INTA, CONICET, and the National University of Mar del Plata. Together, they called a first meeting with the residents of Los Pinos to tell them about the project and the possible implications for their daily lives. However, no one attended and they had to walk through the town knocking on doors, looking for eager listeners. Thanks to that action, they managed to gather a small group, characterized by shyness and suspicion, which gradually grew.\u00a0\nWith the project in motion, the challenge of sustainability needed to be addressed. Then, a group from the School of Economic Sciences of the University of Mar del Plata joined in and traveled to Los Pinos to talk about the different organizational options. Everyone learned a lot during that process. Mercedes shares \u201c\u2026when the people from the School of Economic Sciences spoke, we were the residents of Los Pinos, I mean my group, and the residents of Los Pinos were the real INTA researchers. The roles began to switch.\u201d The exchange of knowledge was so rich that \u201c\u2026a neighbor who always used to come to the meetings [was asked a few questions], and one of the questions was \u2018Do you know what biogas is?\u2019 And this neighbor said, \u2018Now I do.\u2019 \u201d\u00a0\nIn this context, the idea of forming a cooperative came up and, despite the initial suspicion, it then blossomed. The cooperative aims to manage the gas service, ensure long-term continuity and promote local and sustainable development. Members have joined in over time and thus have consolidated a model of organization and participation that represents an important milestone for the community, which did not have prior associations. Mercedes reflects, saying \u201c\u2026the biodigester, before producing 1 milliliter of biogas, had already brought together many of the neighbors, had reunited and organized them, had changed their perspective in terms of producers, and had brought the producers a little closer together. As a technology, it has a lot of collaterals we didn\u0027t expect.\u201d\n","type":"Technological|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation|Biofuels from agricultural waste|Social and socio-economic|Cooperative models and aggregation","type_id":"993, 1044, 1047, 1076, 1077","use_cases":"Production|animal production|optimization of resource use for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change mitigation|Collective action and aggregation|cooperative management to improve efficiency and governance|Governance, policy support and intelligence|promoting ethical practices and community wellbeing","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 909, 916, 919, 973, 974, 980, 991","readiness_level":"7.
