Runoff water is collected from a natural catchment and is led to the pond through a channel that runs alongside a farm road. The catchment area is mostly unproductive private land, and extends to approximately 2 ha in total. Sediment is an issue in the catchment due to the fine sandy outcrops. Sandy particles are thus carried in the runoff \u2013 and require settling out in a sediment trap to limit the turbidity of water in the pond. Thus runoff first enters a stilling basin (a sediment trap) where the suspended solids are deposited: runoff is then transferred through a pipe leading to the pond.\nThe pond\u0027s volume is around 7500 m3, and it is used to irrigate an orchard of about 5 ha in size, which is planted to apples, cherries and olives.  A  precision smart irrigation system is used for water application. The system includes IoT sensors that provide real time information about soil humidity and weather conditions that allow to automatize the valve opening depending on the plant needs thus optimizing the water consumptions. The volume of water collected is not enough to fulfil all the theoretical water requirements of the orchard crops, therefore the irrigation is merely supplementary to rainfall,  and its impact on production is limited. However, the alternative water resource in the area is groundwater. This is high cost and has negative environmental impacts. Therefore the runoff pond technology is preferable for the sustainability of agriculture in the area. If the efficiency of runoff water collection and its application can be improved, then pump withdrawal requirements from groundwater sources decrease and this will optimize the efficiency of irrigation.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies|Internet of Things (IoT)|Sensor|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1015, 1030, 1036, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 920, 910, 914, 909","readiness_level":"7.

Catchment includes rooftops, compounds, rocky surface or hill slopes or artificially prepared impervious\/ semi-pervious land surface. The amount of water harvested depends on the frequency and intensity of rainfall, catchment characteristics, water demands and how much runoff occurs. Contour trenches and pits are one of the oldest and most commonly used water management systems in the hilly areas of Mbale district. Contour trenches and pits are ditches dug along a hillside and run perpendicular to the flow of water. Their main objective is to slow down and attract runoff water which infiltrates into the soil which is used as soil moisture for crop cultivated after a rainfall event.These trenches and pits are constructed and maintained during the dry season. The size of the trenches is based on the slope and soil type. Bulabuli subcounty in Mbale district being a hilly area has trenches which are 5 metres long and 1 metre in width and depth. The materials needed in the construction of the trenches and pits are a hoe and spade. For maintenance they should be checked for build up soil, leaves and branches before the rainy season.The major advantages of rainwater harvesting are that it is simple, cheap, replicable, efficient, sustainable and adaptable and can be applied on any soil type and terrain.  It can be implemented in small-scale, easily maintained and requires low investements which suites the rural community in Mbale district. Rainwater harvesting also has been shown an advantage as it reduces soil erosion, improves soil fertility and increases agricultural productivity as it reduces damage on the crops hence increases income and improves livelihood.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1203, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|income increase|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|field management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 910, 1180, 920, 918, 922, 914","readiness_level":"9.

A system of hand dug  canals \u2013 consisting of a main diversion canal and secondary \/ tertiary canals \u2013 conveys and distributes the captured water to the cultivated fields in naturally flat or leveled areas. The total length of the canal system is 200 \u2013 2000 m. The harvested water is used for growing high value crops, vegetables and fruit trees. Irrigated fields are divided into rectangular basins bordered by ridges to maximize water storage and minimize erosion risk.\nRunoff and floodwater management requires preparedness for immediate action by the farmers: When a flood is expected in the ephemeral river, farmers rush to the diversion site and start erecting the embankment across the bed of the stream. Similarly, each famer starts to maintain the canal which leads water to his field. A schedule defines the date and time each farmer is allocated his turn to irrigate. When the water reaches the field, it is spread either through flooding or distributed in furrows which are opened and closed using a local tool.\nThe ratio between catchment area and production area is 10:1 \u2013 100:1 or greater. While the diversion canals \/ ditches and basins for tree planting are permanent structures, basins for annual crops are seasonal. Soil fertility is improved by additional measures such as composting and mulching. Maintenance, including repairs to breaks along the canal and water conveying ditches, is needed every season before the onset of rains.COMMENTS:Runoff or flood water diversion is a very common farming practice in Dire Dawa and the surrounding areas.

When it rains the dam captures soil laden water behind it \u2013 the sand in the water sinks to the bottom, whilst the silt remains suspended in the water. Eventually the dams fill with sand - sometimes after only one rainfall or over 1 \u2013 3 seasons. 25 to 40% of the volume of the sand held is actually water. A mature sand dam can store millions of litres of water \u2013 refilling after each rainfall providing a year round supply to over 1,000 people.\nPurpose of the Technology: Sand dams are a simple, low cost and low maintenance, replicable rainwater harvesting technology. They provide a clean, local water supply for domestic and farming use and are suited to arid and semi-arid areas of the world. It is a solution that is scaleable and has a broader application for use as a rural and game park road crossing to replace less effective culvert bridges.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Sand dams are the lowest cost form of rainwater harvesting and its robust nature and very low operational and maintenance costs make it particularly suited to remote and poorly served regions. A typical dam using 500 bags of cement would approx be 40 metres in length with a spillway 2 metres above the bedrock. The dam is constructed using stone masonry placed in timber formwork. Such a dam costs approximately USD 11,800 (in 2012 prices). This consists of materials (cement, steel reinforcement, timber, transport) and dam permit USD 8,800 (75%), project management including technical support from skilled local artisans and dam designers USD 2150 (18%) and finance and  administration costs of implementing organisation USD 850 (7%). Local people freely contribute their labour to collect rock, sand and water, terrace and protect the immediate catchment and construct the dam. If this contribution was costed and included the cost of the dam would almost double. The maintenance and repair costs of the dam provided it has been well designed and constructed is negligible. Local users are responsible for the management and repair of the dam and its abstraction system. Where a hand pump is fitted, local users fund the repair and replacement of the pump as required. The purchase and repair of petrol powered water pumps which some groups use to irrigate adjacent land is the responsibility of the members of the local group.\nNatural \/ human environment: Because the water is stored within the sand, evaporation losses are very low, the sand filters the water and water-vector diseases such as malaria are controlled. Sand dams provide significant environmental benefits such as aquifer recharge, increased downstream flows in the dry-season, rejuvenation of river ecologies and moderation of floods. As such, it contributes to ecosystem services and climate change adaption.COMMENTS:Boundary points of the Technology area: An approx. triangular area bordered by Machakos, Kitui and Mitio Andei.\nOver 1000 dams have been built to date in these counties, predominantly by 3 organisations: Utooni Development organisation, SASOL and Africa Sand Dam Foundation in an approx. triangular area bordered by Machakos, Kitui and Mitio Andei.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Drylands are characterised by intense and variable rainfall and a lack of vegetative cover. As a result, drylands are prone to droughts, flooding and soil erosion which result in endemic water and food scarcity.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): \u201cWe used to fetch water from Londokwe; we could spend a night to collect water. One way was 3 to 10 km and up to 12 hours or more to go and come back [because of the time taken to queue]. If we could not make it to the river, we would send our children to fetch water. When they went fetching water that would mean they did not go to school. At times people would fight over fetching water from other people\u2019s scoop holes. Scoop holes would be guarded in turns. The gourds [water containers] would be damaged and the water poured down. Children would not go to school [as they needed to] take care of the young ones as the parents went to fetch water.

These dunes may form as a result of an increase in wind erosion, but more frequently originate from formerly stabilised dunes that have become mobile again following the disappearance of vegetation. Vegetation loss may occur through a combination of unfavourable climatic conditions and overexploitation by grazing and fuelwood gathering.\nPurpose of the Technology: Sustainable dune fixation requires the regeneration of vegetation on the mobile parts of the dunes. For plants to establish, the dunes need to be protected by mechanical measures while being defended against any kind of use. Hence, the technique of dune stabilisation consists of a combination of three measures. These are as follows: (1) Area closure by wire fencing and guarding to prevent exploitation of the area during the rehabilitation phase until vegetation is sufficiently established (2-3 years). (2) Construction of millet stalk palisades arranged ideally in \u2018checker-board\u2019 squares, which act as windbreaks. These physical structures are a barrier to sand transport by wind, and thus are a prerequisite for revegetation. After two years the palisades fall apart and decompose - and the vegetation takes over the dune fixation function. Small erosion gullies can be controlled by check dams made from stone or millet stalks. (3) Natural regeneration, planting and seeding of annual and perennial plants (including Acacia spp. and Prosopis spp.) for soil stabilisation.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: As soon as vegetation cover is established on the denuded surfaces the dunes can be used for grazing or for harvesting of herbs and fuelwood. Period and frequency of use should be determined in common agreement with all actors involved. In addition the pasture on the dune can be used as a \u2019reserve\u2019 for late dry-season grazing, depending on vegetation development and herd size. Between 1991 and 1995, just over 250 ha of sand dunes were stabilised in the case study area. Incentives were provided by the \u2018Projet de D\u00e9veloppement Rural de Tahoua\u2019 (PDRT, see also \u2018Participatory land rehabilitation\u2019 approach). After 1995 no further dunes were stabilised due to the high cost of the wire fencing, which local communities simply could not afford themselves. However, as the objective of the fence is to keep out humans and animals during critical periods (the rainy season), the same effect could be obtained at no financial cost through \u2018social fencing\u2019, that is agreement between stakeholders on where there should be no grazing. Furthermore the technology itself - which works well - could be relevant to situations where higher investment can be justified for specific reasons.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 2 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The area suffers from an imbalance between availability of natural resources (constrained by soil fertility and rainfall) and the rapid growth of the human and livestock populations. As a result, there is chronic food insufficiency and an associated overexploitation of the natural resource base. Accelerated wind and water erosion further enhance the degradation of the soil resources. From the farmers\u2019 perspective, the main problems are lack of grazing land, wood and drinking water (due to sinking water tables), insufficient and unevenly distributed rainfall. Sand dunes are fragile: when overexploited, they soon remain with only unpalatable plant species, eg Panicum turgidum. When the vegetation cover on dunes decreases even further, dunes start moving again, threatening fields, villages or depressions used for fruit and vegetable cropping.\nLongest growing period in days: 90; Longest growing period from month to month: Jul - SepSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement|Social contracts|Institutional|Governance function","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206, 1076, 1091, 1137, 1116, 1129","use_cases":"Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Farm management|disaster management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 1186, 899, 916, 918, 921, 917, 910, 1154, 914, 909","readiness_level":"7.

Dune stabilisation is achieved by setting up windbreaks arranged in a checkerboard pattern, with each side measuring between 10 and 15 m. The windbreaks are formed by palisades made from millet stalks or other plant material or by hedges and trees (Leptadenia pyrotechnica, Euphorbia balsamifera, Acacia raddiana, Acacia senegal, Balanites aegyptiaca, Prosopis juliflora, etc.).\nPurpose of the Technology: They provide protection from wind erosion and reduce the amount of sand blown onto cropland, dwellings and other infrastructure which can prevent extensive damage. Grass and shrubs are planted in strips in the fenced-off areas to further stabilise the soil. The palisades and vegetation provide shade that lowers soil temperatures and the organic matter and waste improves the soil structure.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Specific experience is required to assess the degraded area as a whole and choose the most appropriate techniques, the right species to plant and the most suitable locations. Sometimes, the protected area is rehabilitated, particularly when land use pressure is high in neighbouring areas.\nThe protected dunes must be closely monitored and rigorously maintained for at least three years. It is therefore necessary to ensure good community organisation and take the action required to enforce the rules established and impose fines. Partial use of the area for grazing is sometimes allowed (one day a fortnight). Some projects prefer to fence off the sites with wire fencing to ensure that they are completely protected.\nThe success of this measure depends to a large extent on climatic conditions. A rainy year after the windbreaks have been erected creates favourable conditions for the species planted to become established.\nNatural \/ human environment: With increasingly stronger winds and the accelerated degradation of the natural vegetation growing on sand dunes, it is very likely that the problems caused by shifting dunes will worsen in the future.

It improves the water retention capacity, improves the soil structure (less compaction), eases the nutrient absorption and finally, increases the soil fertility in general.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Be GechkimA sandy soil is a soil type with large particles that has difficulty in retaining both moisture and fertility, which makes it challenging for crop cultivation. Therefore, a practice is needed that helps farmer to improve the quality of such soils. Improving soil quality means to promote a process of constant improvement of soil fertility by maintaining soil moisture, reducing soil compaction, and support to better nutrient absorption, thereby finally promoting better plant growth. Sandy soils are relatively compact and can hamper the growth and penetration of plant roots, what hinders the absorption of nutrients. To reduce this effect, the incorporation of organic matter can be useful (Rhoades, 2016). The farmers have their own techniques to improve sandy soils; one example is the diversified crop cultivation by using natural fertilizer and liquid compost. This technology is applied by one of farmers in the Prey Puoch village, belonging to the Rolea B\u0027ier District.\nHis objective was to improve sandy soils in order to achieve higher production. Apart of the application of liquid compost and natural fertilizers \u2012 and consequently the improvement of the soil nutrient status \u2012 the farmer also increased the range of crops to raise the production level. Therefore, the family was able to raise its surpluses to be sold at the markets significantly. This led to a meaningful improvement of the livelihood. \nThe farmer use only natural fertilizers, such as crops residue, and cow manure or manure from pigs, when cow manure is not available. Although pig manure does not contain the same high level of nutrients as cow manure, it helps to reduce soil compaction, allows crop\u2019s roots to absorb nutrients, and improves soil moisture. In addition, liquid compost can be applied to increase soil fertility, as this kind of compost is rich in microorganisms that play an important role in the decomposition of organic materials. By this, nutrients can be provided in the best possible way. The farmer has planted long beans and other trellising plants in rotation and as inter-crops for example strongly smelling spring onion and anise basil. Such crops grown beneath the long beans can help to reduce pest damage and diminish the use chemical pesticides. Plating anise basil and spring onions along each long bean row and the rotation practices also help maintaining the nutrition level in the soil.\nTo make liquid compost the farmer uses two main ingredients, such as animal (poultry) manure and plant leaves (Siam weed, Cassia tree, Lead tree, Sesbania, etc.). All of the materials are chopped and mixed, and then put into a big jar with 20 times the volume of water being added. The jar is then closed to reduce the unpleasant smell. The mixture is stirred twice daily to provide enough oxygen for the microorganisms. After three weeks the liquid mixture will be no longer smelly, and will be ready for use as liquid compost. This compost is applied three times during the crop cycle: at the start of planting, just before the flowering stage, and at the production stage. The ratio of application is 1 liter of the liquid compost for each square meter of land (Yang and Pean, 2015).\nBefore the farmer adopted this technology they could not even grow water morning glory and they needed a lot of labor and much water for the irrigation. This practice not only helps to improve soil quality, it reduces also the costs by using less chemical fertilizers and pesticides, by reducing the labour input, and it helps to expand the area of arable land.COMMENTS:This technique is applied on an area size of 12 x 30 meters.There are three types of crops such as Long bean, Anise Basil and Spring onion.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Species diversification|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206, 1200, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|minimize pesticide use|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|income increase|field management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 926, 909, 910, 1180, 914","readiness_level":"7.

Over two years 25 ha of Saxaul plantation was established through natural spreading of the plant. The idea came from UNDP who also funded the purchase of seeds, fuel and fertilisers. UNDP further conducted an awareness raising campaign among local land users and members of dekhkan farms about the role of Saxaul bushes in combating land degradation and techniques of planting Saxaul plantations.\nPurpose of the Technology: The Shaartuz area has repeatedly suffered from droughts, and the natural vegetation cover is highly degraded due to overexploitation for firewood. This renders the sandy soils very susceptible to wind erosion. Saxaul plantations have been widely applied in other arid areas of Central Asia to combat desertification, and were selected as an appropriate method for soil fixation around Shaartuz.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Saxaul seeds have to be collected in November, and need to be planted immediately, as otherwise they lose their viability. A tractor was used to plough the land, and the seeds were planted manually. 15 ha of plantation were planted in one single day. As they are not irrigated in this area, the Saxaul bushes are entirely dependent on winter rain and dew for their water supply. The trees grow slowly and need protection from roaming cattle. As the forestry department (leskhoz) responsible for the protection of the plantation has no guards, the project employed a local forester from the Jamoat to protect the area. Meetings were held with surrounding villages to discuss the risk of wind erosion, and the need for the plantations. Also a mobile theatre was involved in order to raise the public awareness with regards to deforestation and desertification issues. An agreement was achieved with the local residents to help protect the newly planted trees from cattle.\nNatural \/ human environment: Saxaul plantations improve vegetation cover, and therefore also increase water infiltration into the soil and improve soil structure. Once the soil has stabilised with the help of the Saxaul bushes, other herbs and bushes will regenerate in the area, and reinforce the vegetation cover. Moreover, different wild animals and birds are already nesting in the area as the vegetation increases.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): removal of natural vegetation cover, loss of topsoil through wind erosion\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): wind erosion, droughts,\nPlantation forestry: Yes\nForest products and services: nature conservation \/ protection\nFuture (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Forests \/ woodlands: Fp: Plantations, afforestationsSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Native species utilization|Drought-resistant techniques|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1201, 1203, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Farm management|disaster management|climate change mitigation","use_cases_id":"916, 927, 917, 918, 921, 922, 910, 1154, 919","readiness_level":"7.

GNH emphasizes values such as compassion, non-killing, and harmonious coexistence with nature.\nThe National Plant Protection Centre (NPPC), Department of Agriculture (DoA), Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MoAL) has been facilitating the application and installation of electric fence systems nationwide. This is achieved through the provision of comprehensive guidelines to help the public comprehend the fundamental components and installation procedures.\nIn essence, the electric fence system consists of three major parts: Energizers, Insulators, and Earth return. The energizer is responsible for generating high-voltage pulse electricity (ranging from 9-12 KV), which is then delivered along the fence wires. The majority of energizers are directly connected to the electricity line, while in some isolated cases, solar panels and batteries are used as alternative power sources. Insulators are typically crafted from a non-conductive material and serve as a barrier between the electrified wire and the wooden post. In the Bhutanese market, these insulators are not readily available, thus as an alternative, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe has been found to be effective and cheap. The electric fence earth return serves as an essential pathway in the electric circuit, collecting high voltage and current from the earth and returning it to the energizer.\nThe loss of crops to wild animals leads to increased production costs in Bhutan (time spent in crop guarding) and the expansion of fallow lands. Farmers often resort to illegal and fatal methods of electric fencing, tapping electricity directly from the main line. To address these issues, the implementation of electric fencing, utilizing imported IEC-certified energizers and locally fabricated fencing materials, has proven to be successful. This electric fencing system, introduced after five years of pre-testing across the country, covers various locations targeting different problem species of animals. Not only is this technology effective in controlling wild pests, but it also enjoys high social acceptance among Bhutanese farmers due to its cost-effectiveness and being non-lethal to wild pests.\nA recent study on the impact of electric fencing on food security focused on the Laptsakha community in Senggye Gewog, Sarpang Dzongkhag. They faced threats to food security from elephants, boar and stray cattle from neighboring communities in India. Crop production in Laptsakha was negligible before the introduction of electric fencing: resettled households contemplated returning, fertile lands were left fallow, and incomes shrank. The turning point came in 2013 with the introduction of electric fencing. This intervention successfully mitigated wildlife attacks on crops, ensuring food security and contributing to a harmonious ecosystem and improved livelihoods for the people of Laptsakha.\nThe electric fence, covering a distance of 7 km, protects a total of 60 households in all, safeguarding about 60 (24 ha) acres of vulnerable lands. Electric fences have various benefits including:\n\u2022Harmonious Approach: they do not cause harm to animals beyond a repellent shock.\n\u2022Economical and Easy to Build: they are cost-effective and relatively easy to construct.\n\u2022Learning and Deterrence: animals quickly learn to respect electric fences.\n\u2022Durability: they have an extended service life.\n\u2022Versatility: they offer a variety of designs and can control a wide range of wild animals.\nThe installation of an electric fence involves a participatory approach and several key steps:\n\u2022Location and Length: determine the location and approximate length of the electric fence either by manual measurement, or remote technologies for larger expanses.\n\u2022Material Estimation: estimate the required materials per kilometre based on the identified area, including wooden poles, HDPE pipe, and GI wire.\n\u2022Additional Materials: Consider other essential materials like energizers, solar panels, charge controllers, and batteries, depending on the specific requirements.\n\u2022Cost Estimation: Calculate the cost of installation, which varies regionally.  For example, to instal one kilometre of an electric fence is estimated at about Nu. 7,450 (USD 95) excluding labour costs and cost of wooden poles which is sourced locally.\nThe implementation of electric fencing in the community has brought significant advantages, particularly in securing food. Prior to this intervention, the community faced severe challenges in harvesting crops, with approximately 70% of fertile lands being left fallow due to constant human-wildlife conflicts. Crop guarding became routine \u0026amp; risky.\nWith the introduction of electric fences, the community\u0027s agricultural landscape has undergone a positive transformation. Crop diversification has been enhanced, encompassing maize, ginger, paddy, mandarin fruit trees and areca nut. The frequency of wild elephant attacks has significantly decreased, leading to a notable increase in crop production. This has resulted in secured food sources and improved livelihoods. Additionally, the community has successfully revived previously fallow lands.\nWhile the electric fencing has proven effective, there are challenges faced by the land users, notably the frequent damage to energizers, primarily attributed to thunderstorms. This has resulted in higher maintenance costs. In one specific instance, the community had to mobilize approximately Nu. 145,000 (USD 1800) independently to replace damaged energizers and other materials, supplementing the continued support from the government.COMMENTS:The Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, situated in western Sarpang Dzongkhag and south-eastern Dagana Dzongkhag along the border with West Bengal, is the second-smallest national park in Bhutan, covering an area of 268.93 square kilometers. This sanctuary is linked to Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park and Royal Manas National Park through a biological corridor that crosses a national highway. The elevations within the sanctuary range from 200 meters to 1,600 meters.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Digital technologies|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation|Solar-powered farming systems|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1015, 1044, 1045, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Farm management|field management|income increase|disaster management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 910, 914, 1180, 1154, 915, 918","readiness_level":"9.

Pastoralism in the country is based on the mobility of herds in a context of irregular precipitation and variable forage resources in time and space, and benefits from complementary relationships between the different ecological zones. In Chad, herds are taken in regular movements with the seasons between the Sahelian and the Sudanese grazing areas. The former are nutritious but limited in quantity, while the latter are more abundant but of lower quality, and not accessible until the fields are cleared after the harvest (meta-evaluation of projects on pastoral water sources, IIED, 2013). Thus, pastoral livestock keeping is founded on mobility and rangeland management, and on building complementary relationships and trade around farming systems and cultivated areas. The pastoralist systems are economically competitive (limited use of food inputs), and occur in marginal land which is characterized by conflicts, riots and a high level of insecurity (Conference of N\u0027Djamena: \u0027Pastoral livestock keeping: a sustainable contribution to development and security in Saharan and Sahelian regions\u0027). In the pastoral zone of Chad, where access to water is limited, the management and control of water sources by a social group in practice also leads to the monitoring and control of the use of grazing land which becomes available when water is present. \nThe project Almy Al Afia (2004-2016), developed by a partnership between the AFD and the Ministry of Water of Chad, operated in two regions of central Chad. The project Almy Al Afia was based on an entry \u0027development\u0027, concurrently with a process to consult and involve joint agencies. The project has improved approaches of preceding initiatives: concerted action and identification of water sources derived from the dialogue between users and authorities, and development of the local management of infrastructures and rangeland. The latter counteracts an exclusively private management or, instead, an ineffective public management which promotes free access to water sources and grazing land.  \nThe project has enabled to address the following points:\n1. Support mobility in pastoralism by enhancing the access to water (rehabilitation and construction of 160 wells; digging of 31 ponds for pastoral use);\n2. Maintain or build processes of consultation and restoring security (joint committees for consultation and prevention of conflicts during transhumance);\n3. Promote the proper use of water supply structures, in time and space (rehabilitated and new wells, excavated ponds) by context-specific management (strengthening of traditional management systems) and encourage the maintenance of infrastructure.\nThe pastoral ponds should be constructed in locations of existing water sources (natural ponds in suitable places, i.e. with a clayey soil capable to retain water). The existing water source is enlarged and improved by rural engineering (enlargement of the surface, deepening).\nThe wells are rehabilitated. Most wells were constructed several decades ago and are severely damaged. The water supply structures all have different and complementary functions. The deep wells in the pastoral zone are generally used throughout the year, and are overexploited. The way in which these structures are managed is strongly anchored in the region. The District officer delegates the management to \u0027Heads of Wells\u0027. These old wells, which are used day and night, are often in a poor condition. Rehabilitating degraded wells is given priority over digging new wells because of the substantial potential for conflict. The water supply structures in areas of dry forest are less old and smaller in number. These wells are less frequently used and function as an alternative water source when the traditional ponds, water reservoirs and wells have dried up. They allow to delay the movement of the herds towards grazing areas in the Sahelian zone.\nThe strip between these two zones is used for agropastoralism. Herds cannot remain there. Therefore the project has facilitated the movement of the herds to the zones further south.  The pastoral ponds close to the livestock routes for the transhumance were created in a way to be easily used by the herders, but also to encourage short stays.\nThe approach was combined with consultation through joint committees for the prevention of conflicts, and at a later stage by marking of sections of the livestock routes for the transhumance. Many meetings were held with the users of the land management structures and policy makers, with the aim to identify and negotiate the target sites and to anticipate methods for the management and maintenance of the structures. This has enabled to maintain an atmosphere of social stability conducive to cooperation. Along almost 550 km of the livestock routes for the transhumance, sections were marked (\u0027mourhals\u0027 in Chadian Arabic). The demarcation was not intended to enclose the herds in the livestock corridors (from which they can move freely outside the growing seasons for agricultural crops), but rather to implement the results of the consultations on the land use on the ground. The committees for the prevention of conflicts, which were supported by the project, also played a major role.COMMENTS:Main towns of the two relevant regions (Ati for the region of Batha and Mongo for the region of Gu\u00e9ra).\nThe water sources constitute an anchorage point for the herds. The surrounding grazing land is controlled by the access to the water supply points (impact zone with a radius of 15 to 20 km around the wells). Apart from the area directly influenced by the technology, complementary relationships between the zones provide an added value: hence the zone targeted by the decision-making process of the herders is very large.Number of growing seasons per year: 1\nLivestock density: Variable depending on zones and seasons.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Institutional|Governance function|Knowledge management function|Partnerships|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1206, 1116, 1129, 1123, 1135, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"897, 1186, 899, 916, 920","readiness_level":"7.

The initial phase, known as \u201cpurification\u201d, occurs in the fields before the harvest. This phase focuses on weeding out unwanted plants, such as Cichorium intybus in bersim (Trifolium sp.). Post-harvest, each farmer engages in the process of cleaning the seeds to eliminate impurities using the means available to them (e.g. manually with basic implements).\nTypically, additional seed cleaning, known as winnowing, is carried at the El Grine forage and pasture seed production center of the Livestock and Pasture Office (OEP) to meet quality standards.\nIn collaboration with national partners, the ProSol Tunisia project, spearheaded by OEP, has introduced an innovative, locally produced, \u0022mobile seed cleaning and treatment unit\u0022. This unit, designed by a local machinery manufacturer, consists of various sieves tailored to different forage seed species (barley, vetches, faba beans, bersim, alfalfa, fenugreek, oats, forage peas, etc.).\nA bucket chain feeds raw seeds directly into the machine\u0027s intake funnel at a height of 2 m. The unit operates on 220 V, ensuring ease of use for beneficiaries on their farms.\nUnder the ProSol\/OEP partnership, two mobile seed conditioning units have been acquired. The first is allocated to the El Grine center in Kairouan, serving alfalfa seed multipliers either on their farms or at the center. The second is delivered to the OEP Fritissa farm, benefiting sulla, bersim, and other seed multipliers.\nTo boost the production of forage legumes, cooperatives in different regions have purchased these units, making them available to their members and developing a business model around mechanization. Through these mobile seed cleaning and treatment units, seed quality is enhanced, leading to increased revenue for farmers. Additionally, a business plan has been developed to create job opportunities and boost income for professional agricultural organizations (OPAs), mutual agricultural services societies (SMSAs), and others. This has encouraged cooperatives to acquire additional units, providing farmers with valuable services and contributing to economic growth.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Harvesting and processing equipment","type_id":"993, 1188, 1192","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|Farm management|income increase|equipment management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Collective action and aggregation|cooperative management to improve efficiency and governance|support to collective selling to access larger markets|shared economy support to share equipment and reduce individual costs","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 910, 1180, 913, 915, 973, 974, 976, 977","readiness_level":"8.

It is also applicable for cowpeas, groundnuts and sesame. Priming will increase the water use efficiency because the seed can start to germinate immediately after sowing. Results from Mali (Koro and Segou) show that yields can be increased by 50 % if microfertilization is combined with seed priming. Other benefits are reduced labour constraints (thanks to simultaneous application) and risk reduction. Seed priming and microfertilization can be practiced independently from each other; however, the combination reduces the risk of crop failure and shows best results in terms of yield increase. Microfertilization has also been mechanised in Mali.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Seed priming should be carried out after a rain shower sufficient for sowing (15-20 mm) at the beginning of the rainy season. After soaking, the seeds should be air dried for 1 hour prior to sowing (to reduce the stickiness of the seeds and to reduce risk of burning by fertilizer). Fertilizer (NPK 16-16-16; or DAP) is applied at a micro-dose of 0.3 g per planting station, equivalent to 3-8 kg fertilizer\/ha, dependent on plant population density.

Flemengia is a leguminous perennial, deep rooting and leafy shrub with plant height ranging from 0.5 -2.5 m. Indigofera is also a perennial shrub with height of 0.4-1.3 m. The leaves and other plant parts of these shrubs are used as mulch, green manure, feeds for livestock while hard portions and branches are used as firewood. It is regarded as high drought resistant, staying green even during dry periods of 3-4 months.

It was introduced from Alaska to increase soil cover and fertilize the sandy and gravelly soil. For that purpose, it has been widely used from 1990 onwards in degraded areas all over Iceland. Because of its large amount of seed production, the plant is able to reproduce rapidly and spread. The ability of the lupine to fix nitrogen through its root system reduces the need for fertilizer - especially when planting trees. Increased vegetation cover due to the lupine plants minimizes vulnerability to wind erosion. The ground is protected and sandstorms can be reduced. This also protects neighbouring fields, and public and private infrastructure from sand and dust storms.\nThe lupine is seeded with machinery in spring or very late autumn. It is planted in strips \u2013 rather than all over the ground - because the plant readily spreads and colonise. Before planting, lupine seed have to be inoculated with rhizobium bacteria. These bacteria help the plant to fix nitrogen: without this inoculation the plant wouldn\u2019t survive in the bare soil. These bacteria are produced during winter time in a laboratory. The lupine needs no fertilizer after planting. Planting of lupine is an extremely cost-efficient and effective way of increasing soil cover and soil fertility. It is a one-off operation: no further action needs to be carried out afterwards.\nHowever, the nootka lupin is very controversial in Iceland despite its apparent advantages both on and offsite. The use of lupines should be carefully considered, especially in sensitive and protected areas. The reason is that this non-native plant is very invasive and leads to the displacement of the native vegetation. Grazing does not stop lupines spreading: only young plants are eaten by sheep, but once mature, its bitterness renders it unpalatable. On a small-scale, it is possible - with great effort - to slow down the spread by cutting the flowers. On a large-scale, the spread can only be stopped with herbicides which is highly controversial. From the land user\u2019s view, the planting of lupine reduces the aesthetic value of the landscape because of monoculture: diversity is lost. That is why people try to plant trees in such fields. Because of the controversy surrounding the plant, the technology has been little adopted by farmers and due to its invasiveness, the Soil Conservation Service stopped using the lupine in 2018.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biologicals|Biotechnologies|Biofertilizers and biopesticides|Bioremediation and phytoremediation|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Native species utilization","type_id":"993, 2100, 994, 1001, 1000, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1201","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Farm management|field management|forestry management","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 917, 918, 919, 922, 910, 914, 927","readiness_level":"7.

Due to its spreading, rhizomatous habit it survives and spreads in sand and even in blown sand. The sand can be captured and stabilised, and vegetation cover increases. In this way, new vegetation cover comprising other plants can further develop. Therefore, this plant is used on degraded land with sandy soils to restore and hinder it from further erosion. Wind erosion can be minimized or stopped. Lyme grass protects and prevents the soil from being blown away and from causing damage on- and offsite. For these reasons, it has been applied in various locations throughout Iceland. \nLyme grass is seeded in with machinery in early spring or late autumn over a complete area. Before planting, the seeds have to be treated in order to go through the drilling machine. These seeds are harvested with specialized machinery in September. In order to promote growth and spread, the plants are supported with fertilizer in the four years after application. Normally this activity is carried out in early spring. The use of imported fertilizer is necessary, but quite expensive. Because lyme grass is sensitive to grazing, a fence is often built to protect the area from livestock. In more advanced restored land, seasonally controlled grazing in the summer with sheep can take place again. Sandy areas remain protected because of their vulnerability to wind erosion.\nOnce planted, lyme grass spreads by itself through rhizomes, and by producing large amounts of seeds every year. It is winter hardy - and copes well with droughts because of its deep roots. Lyme grass is highly appreciated because it brings clear long-term improvement onsite and provides offsite benefits. Onsite, Lyme grass improves soil and vegetation cover and minimizes evaporation from the soil surface. In addition, surface runoff is minimized. Less sediment is transported with the wind and damage to the neighbouring field or private and public infrastructure is minimised offsite. Furthermore, lyme grass can also store large quantities of carbon. Because of its many positive features, this technology is being adopted in many places.COMMENTS:Lyme grass is very sensitive to grazing.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Harvesting and processing equipment|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Native species utilization","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1192, 1196, 1198, 1201","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|Farm management|field management|disaster management","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 921, 922, 918, 919, 910, 914, 1154","readiness_level":"9.

At present, there is a high fire incidence. Post-fire landscapes regenerated with a high and continuous fuel accumulation with few native resprouter species. Therefore appropriate vegetation management is crucial.\nFor management the major goals are to reduce the fuel load and its continuity and to increase the resilience of the vegetation to fires. Within this experiment carried out by CEAM (Centro de Estudios Ambientales del Mediterr\u00e1neo, University of Valencia) different fuel management techniques were examined. They selected three study sites (Morera, Ro\u00f1oso, Gachas) with a similar history of land use, vegetation composition, soil characteristics, and a typical post-fire scenario whith scarce occurrence of resprouter species. In each site, four plots were established to test the effect of the following management techniques: 1) control (no action), 2) clearing, 3) planting (within the shrubland) and 4) the combination of clearing and planting.\nThe main purpose of this experiment was to find out which management technique is the most appropriate to prevent fires and it was shown that the combination of selective clearing of fire-prone shrubs (fuel control) and planting of more resistant resprouter species can increase the resilience to fires and is therefore a suitable management practice. Compared to the other management techniques, there are some advantages. Clearing the vegetation (either by hand or mechanically) reduces the fire risk and enhances seedling establishment and growth. Furthermore, the cleared vegetation is chipped and applied in-situ as mulch, which protects the soil from erosion, reduces soil temperature and moisture loss, and enhances carbon conservation. Additionnally, selective clearing allows to preserve desired species and by planting resprouter species the natural processes can be accelerated. Once established, resprouter species persist for a long time which promotes an increase of the vegetation resilience.\nIn this documentation, only the combination of clearing and planting is evaluated since this action is considered as the most appropriate management practice.\nIn each study site, the experimental area covered about 5000m2 (3 plots of 1000m2 each, one plot of 2000m2). To test the effect of the combination of clearing and planting, a clearing machine was used to clear a plot of 1000 m2 in all three sites. The few resprouting individuals such as Juniperus oxycedrus and Quercus ilex and also some seeder trees such as Pinus halepensis and Pinus pinaster were left standing. The planting holes (0.35 m2) were created with a tractor using a backhoe. The slash and brush chips generated by the clearing were reused in the planting holes as mulch which resulted in ecological benefits.\nIn February 2003, native resprouters of late successional stages with a low amount of dead fuel were planted, such as Quercus ilex, Rhamnus alaternus and Pistacia lentiscus, all protected by a plastic tree shelter to prevent browsing.\nThe seedlings were grown for 8 months in a nursery in Santa Faz (Alicante) and then transferred to a nursery in La Hunde (Ayora) one month before planting. The Regional Forest Services of Valencia provided seeds as well.\nThe region of Ayora is mountainous with a dry subhumid climate (~380 mm annual rainfall). The risk of fire incidence is at its highest from June to September when there are adverse conditions like drought, high temperatures and strong winds (mainly the winds coming from central Spain, called \u201cponiente\u201d).

These disturbances resulted in the degradation of the vegetation, the reduction of the resilience of the ecosystem against fires and thus an increasing risk of wildfires. After fires, many landscapes regenerated with a high and continuous fuel accumulation with few native resprouter species, which made it extremely difficult to control forest fires. The dense growth not only increased the risk of wildfires but also the competition between different species (nutrients, light, space). Therefore appropriate vegetation management to increase the resilience of the ecosystem to fires and to reduce competition is crucial.\nThese problems are approached by selective forest clearing. The main purposes of thinning dense pine forests are the prevention of fires by reducing the fuel load and its continuity, and to improve pine regeneration by eliminating the competition between different species. As a result, the quality of the plants is improved and the amount of dead or sick plants is reduced, which is essential to ensure a healthy forest. This also leads to a higher resistance to pests which in turn again decreases the risk of fire (less dead plants). Vegetation removal produces fresh vegetation growth, therefore more diverse and nutritious fodder is provided to animals (game and livestock) in the cleared areas which is a benefit for herders. Also wild animals use this fodder supply which in turn hinders them to destroy cultivated fields of the farmers. Furthermore, honey producers make use of the enhanced growth of shrubs and the additional space created by selective clearing to place their beehives and to increase honey production.\nEspecially during the current economic crisis forest management is an important source for jobs - most of the workers were unemployed before working in the selective clearing. Through the clearings, fuelwood is gained and offered to retired people for free for cooking and heating, allowing them to save money. Additionally, almost all villagers like to have a cleared forest due to its high aesthetic and recreational value.\nIn order to be selective and to preserve desired species, the clearing is done with small machines such as brushcutters and chainsaws. On average the forest is thinned until reaching a density of 800-1200 trees\/ha. Species such as Juniperus, Rhamnus al., Quercus rotundifolia, Quercus faginea or Fraxinus ornus are not removed which increases the probability to have a more fire-resistant vegetation composition in future. Dead or sick plants and also a part of fire-prone shrubs such as Ulex parv. and Cistus alb. are removed. If there are both Pinus pinaster and Pinus halepensis. Pinus halepensis is cleared because they compete with each other. The roots are not removed which ensures the stability and productivity of the soil. The remaining species are pruned (\u201cpoda\u201d) until a maximum height of 2.5m to improve the conditions of the species. Around each tree they should clear an area of 2m.\nAfter felling trees and shrubs a part of the residues is chipped in-situ and covers the soil as mulch, which results in ecological benefits (e.g. increase in soil moisture, prevention from erosion, enhancement of nutrient cycling, reduction of the soil surface temperature).\nIf the slope is steep, it takes more time to do the clearing and it might also increase the risk of erosion afterwards. Under the best conditions (e.g. good access and terrain), 0.8ha per day are cleared (calculated for a group of 9 persons working 7 hours). In this case the costs are paid by the municipal council, which receives a part of the money from the rental fee paid by the wind mill company. The cleared areas have to be maintained depending on the speed of the vegetation growth (which amongst others depends on the soil, slope and humidity). If the clearings are done regularly, it takes less time and it is cheaper than the first clearing. It should be noted that recurrent maintenance is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the technology.\nThe region of Ayora is mountainous with a dry subhumid climate (~380 mm annual rainfall). The risk of fire incidence is at its highest from June to September when there are adverse conditions like drought, high temperatures and strong winds (mainly the winds coming from central Spain, called \u201cponiente\u201d). The population density is very low and there are only few job opportunities (e.g. marginal agriculture, grazing, hunting, beekeeping). Most of the inhabitants work in the nuclear power plant. Forest management could be a source for jobs.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.5 km2.\nThe forest agent told me that during this project they are clearing some 50 ha of forest. But in total (including the clearings in the past) they cleared more than 1000 ha in Jarafuel.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The prevalent dense shrublands (dominated by seeder species), which resulted from past agricultural land use (changes of the vegetation composition, e.g. removal of key species), land abandonment\/rural depopulation and fire occurrence, contain a high fire risk because of both the high fuel loads and their continuity. Also dense forests (either afforestations or natural regeneration) show a high risk for fires. Through the modifications of the vegetation composition in the past (removal of more fire resistant resprouter species, whereas fire-prone seeder species are abundant), the resilience of the ecosystem to fires has decreased. Today a higher fire recurrence can be observed which could still be worsen by future climate change impacts, undermining more and more the ecosystem\u2019s capacity to buffer such shocks. Furthermore, the high density of the forest results in a competition between different species which increases the amount of dead or thin material.\nSelective felling of (semi-) natural forests: As a management practice.

These are small-scale stone structures, with diameters between 3-5 m, established to catch rainfall and runoff from small micro-catchments covering relatively short slopes. This type of freestanding system (not contour system) is suitable for fields where trees are distributed in a staggered array. The slope steepness ranges from 15-40 degrees. Stones are mined from wasteland and transported to the slopes using tractors. Then the stones are set out in a semi circle (crescent) manually from a down side of the tree. The stone bunds are about 40 cm high with a base width of 30-40 cm. Most of the farmers add soil around the tree trunk and some of them add manure to improve the soil fertility. The technology makes the mechanized tillage difficult because of the layout of the structures. This reduces number of tillage operations and hence reduces erosion since tillage is one of the main causes of soil erosion under these conditions. The structures also reduce runoff velocity, which increases water availability for the plant roots (water harvesting) and also allows for more sedimentation around the trees and less transportation of soil particles and nutrients outside the field (soil conservation).\nPurpose of the Technology: Semi-circle stone bunds are used to reduce losses of soil and nutrients and capture runoff water which helps to rehabilitate degraded land and improves the yield.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: For one hectare of land with 100 bunds approximately 50 persons are needed to establish the bunds. The stones are set out in a semi-circle manually. A shovel is needed to prepare and level the stones bed. The costs are about $1950, which includes the price of the stones, transportation, equipment and labours. Then the bunds need maintenance every year, this will cost $54 per hectare. The perennial olive trees are mainly planted in January.\nNatural \/ human environment: The area is dominated by steep slopes in a mountainous area in the north west of Syria. Small holdings are typical for this area with small plot sizes, narrow fields and shallow soil. Annual rainfall is between 400-600 mm. The technology was introduced to the community few years ago.

They are constructed on gently to moderately sloping pediments and plateau areas in order to rehabilitate areas that are degraded, denuded and\/or affected by soil crusting.\nDepending on their purpose, the areas inside the semi-circular bunds, enriched with organic fertiliser, are used for growing cereals (crop crescents) and for planting trees, bushes and\/or grasses (forestry and pastoral crescents). Semi-circular bunds slow down and capture runoff, providing the plants inside them with the water they need. They therefore reduce the loss of water and the fertile layers of the soil. This is particularly advantageous when rain is scarce, as the semi-circular bunds channel water towards the plants, increasing the moisture available to them. In the medium term, rich sediment builds up behind the semi-circular bunds, which helps to protect and restore the land. The bunds ensure that the manure placed around the plants inside them is not washed away by heavy rains, and the ridge of the bund protects young plants from the wind and wind erosion. When they are used for reforestation, they increase the rate of survival of the trees planted in them. Cropland bunds enable crops to survive dry spells. Earthen bunds are not, however, suitable in a scenario with heavy rainfall. They do not allow water to filter through, which can result in the soil inside them becoming waterlogged and the plants being flooded. This can lower yields in the case of crops that do not tolerate excess water. In such conditions, stone bunds are preferable.\nTo establish semi-circular bunds on cropland, the following activities are required: marking out the contour line, laying out the lines of the semi-circular bunds in staggered rows, digging the microcatchment, forming the ridge downhill of the microcatchment, applying organic fertiliser (around 1 t per ha per year).\nTo establish semi-circular bunds on forestland the same steps are required, however instead of applying fertilizer, other steps include digging the holes, planting the trees, and sowing grass on the ridges. The earthen ridges around cropland bunds need to be rebuilt each year. It is recommended that the ridges of forest\/rangeland bunds be maintained each year and raised if overflowing has occurred. Forest\/rangeland sites should be protected from grazing animals in the first two to three years, until the vegetation is well established. This requires good community organisation. After dry years, forest\/rangeland semi-circular bunds may have to be re-sown with grasses and replanted with trees.\nThe Sahel is a region where the population has always faced a high degree of climate variability, manifested both in terms of time (unexpected dry spells can occur during the rainy season) and in terms of space (rainfall can vary greatly from one area to another). The population is mainly composed of small farmers and livestock keepers.\nOver the last two decades, the effects of climate change have exacerbated the already difficult conditions. Accord\u00acing to projections made by climatologists, the Sahel will experience a rise in temperatures combined with highly variable rainfall and an increase in extreme weather events. The Soil and Water conservation and rehabilitation techniques have helped people in the Sahel to manage their ecosystems more effectively and improve their productive land. As a result, communities are better prepared to cope with environmental changes (changes in the climate, land degradation, etc.) and the im\u00acpact of shocks, particularly droughts.COMMENTS:Also implemented in Burkina Faso and Chad\nRegions of Tillab\u00e9ri, Filingu\u00e9, Ouallam, T\u00e9ra and Tahuoa in Niger; Bam region in Burkina FasoMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): droughts, soil erosion, lack of water, surface runoff, soil crusting, unadapted land use methods, rapidly growing population increasing pressure on land, reduced or abandoned fallow periods, soil erosion, insecure access to land.\nCut-and-carry\/ zero grazing, Improved pasture, agropastolralism\nLivestock density: 1-10 LU \/km2SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|forestry management|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"916, 918, 921, 897, 898, 1186, 927, 910, 914, 909, 920","readiness_level":"7.

The goats are  kept under confinement for some period of time (weeks to months, especially during the dry seasons). During dry season, the animals are fed on maize bran; iodized salt; peelings from banana, cassava, and sweet potatoes; and improved grasses (Napier) and forages planted at the boundaries of the banana plantation, which are harvested during the period of need.\nThe farmer has got 2 ha of banana plantation. She grows a fodder hybrid called Napier (pennisetum perpureum) around the plantation to be used as fodder for the goats during dry season. Napier grass is a perennial grass fodder commonly called elephant Grass due to its tallness and vigorous vegetative growth. She got the Napier root cuttings from the neighbor practicing the same technology. This is grown around the banana plantation, at a spacing of 60\u00d760cm. It produces more tillers with soft and juicy stem, free from pest and diseases and non-lodging. It can be cultivated throughout the year. Napier grasses contain 6-8% protein. Its optimum cutting interval is about 6 to 8 weeks at grass range of 60 to 90 cm, if sufficient only the tops can be cut and fed. The grass is cut into 5 to 10 cm to reduce loses.\nThe extensive system is practiced during rainy season where the farmer grows a mixture of fodder species including Sesbania and Napier grass grown on land size of 0.5 ha. Sesbania is a fast-growing tree with regular and rounded leaves. The flowers are white and red in color according to its species but the ones at the farm are yellow. The leaves of Sesbania trees are highly palatable and mostly liked by goats. The protein content in this is about 25%. 1kg of seed was planted at a spacing of 100 cm x 100 cm. In this field Napier grass is  planted in rows at a spacing of 60\u00d760cm. The seeds for Sesbania were supplied to the farmer by the Kabarole District Production Office.\nFarmers in Kabarole District use the Semi-intensive system for rearing both local and improved breeds of goats. As dry spells are increasingly becoming common, this technology helps farmers to go through the dry season with enough feed for the goats. Farmers prefer rearing goats because they don\u2019t have complicated feeding and medical requirements. As the human population grows and land fragmentation increases, farmers in this area are now moving towards intensive feedings systems.\nThroughout seasons of abundant forage, farmers harvest the forage together with grasses and make hay to feed the goats during the dry season when pastures are scarce. The cost of harvesting the hay is comparable to the cost of paying a herdsman in open grazing systems. Besides, the establishment of the shelter for goats is not cumbersome compared to those of other animals. The constructed structure occupies an area of about 12 \u00d712 meters squared with  length of 10 meters and width is 3 meters.  It is lifted ground to floor 1.5 meters and floor to roof by 2.5 meters. Further partitioned in 4 units and each unit measurement is 3  meters with a slope angle of 20 degrees. The Capacity of each unit is 18,17,17 and 18 goats respectively.\n The shelter for the goats is made from relatively cheap materials that are readily available to the farmers. The farmer rears 70 goats on 1-acre piece of land using this technology. By planting improved forages in the grazing areas, the farmer receives  increased  amount of forage harvested as well as the quality of grass available to the goats during the open grazing periods and income after sale.One challenge of this technology is the dependence on family labor that is not always sufficient for all the tasks involved in the technology both at establishment and maintenance in addition to complications with  of  rural-urban migration of youth, thereby leaving the workload to the elderly.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1199, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|animal production|improved animal breeds|livestock monitoring|animal health|Farm management|income increase|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 903, 905, 907, 910, 1180, 915, 916, 918","readiness_level":"9.

The surge in demand for dairy products has positioned AI technology as key in transforming dairy farms from subsistence to market-oriented production systems.\nA recent addition to the programme is the use of sexed semen, meaning sorting of semen before artificial insemination. Semen sorting involves categorizing bull semen based on the X and Y chromosomes, thus granting dairy land users control over calf gender. This empowers them to engage in selective breeding, enhancing desired traits and overall quality of dairy production.\nSeveral key activities are integral to this technology:\n\u2022Rigorous selection of bulls with desirable traits related to milk production and overall health.\n\u2022Collection and preservation of semen from selected bulls.\n\u2022Semen sorting technology to separate X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm.\n\u2022Artificial insemination of dairy cows by extension agents who use sorted semen.\nThe benefits are multiple because achieving a higher proportion of heifer calves helps dairy land users to enhance breeding strategies and maintain desired traits within the herd. Economic benefits follow through increased dairy production and improved cattle health.\nLand users express satisfaction with the technology and its impact. However, some households report problems with conception rates after AI with sexed semen. Despite these drawbacks, the overall benefits to dairy land users and the industry outweigh the limitations.COMMENTS:The land is where the manure of the dairy cattles are applied on.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Genetic engineering and gene editing (CRISPR, etc.)|Nature-based solutions|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)","type_id":"993, 994, 995, 1196, 1199","use_cases":"Production|animal production|improved animal breeds|livestock monitoring|animal health|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|income increase|Access to markets|market forecasting for production and inventory planning","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 903, 905, 907, 909, 910, 1180, 928, 933","readiness_level":"7.

Coffee yields a harvest after two years, but timber from associated trees can be expected after only 25 years. The trees grown in association allow more efficient cycling of nutrients (because of deep rooting and nitrogen fixation) and provide a favourable microclimate for coffee.

Simultaneously there is a movement towards farming methods that preserve soil health by reducing deep tillage. Thus, farmers have developed a surface rotting system that protects soil while safely eliminating a cover crop. \u201cShallow rotary tillage with microbial digestion\u201d is a technique that is used to destroy cover crops and to manage stubble. Overwintering catch crops\/undersown plants or field forage are turned over in spring or autumn. The plant material is broken down to small pieces and incorporated into the surface layer of the soil (around 5 cm deep). By use of a field rototiller, the vegetation is mechanically destroyed and mixed with the soil particles. Depending on the activity of organisms in the soil, microorganisms may then be introduced to accelerate the decomposition process of the plant material.  A second pass may be required after 7- 14 days. Aerobic decomposition of the plant material takes place on the surface\/ within the top layer of the soil. The advantages of this surface rotting can be summarised as follows:\n\u2022No synthetic agents are used.\n\u2022The soil is not inverted but only superficially mixed.\n\u2022The soil structure and its pore system are preserved.\n\u2022Organic material is introduced into the soil and thus soil organisms are promoted.\nThe challenge with surface rotting is the weather. The soil must be sufficiently dry to avoid creating smear layers, but if it is too dry, the fuel input to power the machine increases. However, if the weather is too wet after rototilling, there is a risk of re-growth of the plants. The blades of the tiller must be sufficiently sharp to cut the vegetative core of the plants well. The use of effective microorganisms is not yet scientifically proven - and the price of these products is high: some farmers even produce their own microbially-rich \u201ccompost tea\u201d.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|minimize pesticide use|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|climate change mitigation|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 917, 926, 897, 898, 910, 914, 919, 918","readiness_level":"7.

Such shelterbelts around farmland help reduce natural hazards including sandstorms, wind erosion, shifting sand, droughts and frost. They also improve the microclimate (reduced temperature, wind speed, soil water loss and excessive wind-induced transpiration) and create more favourable conditions for crop production. Thus the establishment of shelterbelts plays a crucial role in the sandy drylands that are affected by wind and resultant desertification\nespecially during winter and spring. Where there is irrigation, the shelterbelts protect the infrastructure from silting-up with wind-borne sediment.\nStrips of tall growing species (15-25 m) of poplar (Populus spp.) or willow (Salix spp.) were originally (from 1960s onwards) planted in a 400 by 600 m rectangular grid pattern within extensive areas of cropland, with an extra belt of windbreaks on the windward side (against the prevailing wind). Generally, the distance effectively protected is 15-25 times the tree height. Strips are of variable width, consisting of 2-5 tree lines (1-3 m apart) with trees planted every 1-2 m within the lines. Selective felling is used to maintain adequate growing space and the protective effect of the trees.\nThe impact of the shelterbelts depends on the planting pattern of the trees (the format of strips and grids), the orientation of the shelterbelts in relation to the wind, the spacing between, and the width of each strip and the type of trees planted. The specific design is primarily based on preventing the negative effects of wind, but depends also on local conditions such as the layout of the land, the location of the roads, farm boundaries and irrigation canals. Ideally the tree strips are perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction, and the angle between the strip and the prevailing wind is never less than 45 degrees. The structure of the strips determines the way the wind is controlled, ranging from blocking the wind\nto letting it diffuse through semi-permeable shelterbelts. The best effect is achieved if the wind is not blocked entirely, as this can cause turbulence.\nThe ownership of the land and the shelterbelts still rests with the state, but management has been more and more transferred to individual households. On condition that the impact of the shelterbelt is not affected, the local forestry agencies now allow some felling of mature trees - on a rotational and selective basis, for timber and firewood.

Dusty storms not only damage the crops but they also cause damage to the main surface, the fertile layer of soil. Sand also damages the irrigation canals, roads, gardens and streets in urban areas which forces people to leave such areas. Good yields cannot be achieved if fields are not properly protected.\nA solution to this problem is the planting of shelterbelts around fields to slow wind speed and to prevent erosion of the arable soil layer. During Soviet times shelterbelts were planted on collective farms by the state forestry committee under contracts. After the collapse of the USSR and before the formation of Dehkan farms land users were not interested in investing in shelterbelts due to unprotected land use rights and unclear legal procedures. One farmer however tested the planting of a shelterbelt in 1992 when his son came back from his studies at the Agricultural University where he had learnt about the technology. They planted the first shelterbelt using a mixture of different tree species to protect newly irrigated fields. Due to financial constraints they could not invest in any other shelterbelts but in 2010 UNDP provided them with financial support to buy seedlings to increase the shelterbelt area. For this new shelterbelt the native Russian Silverberry (Elaeagnus angustifolia) was considered the most appropriate species as soils were highly saline and only this species proved tolerant.\nTrees were planted in three rows, along field boundaries and also along irrigation channels. Within rows trees were spaced at a 1m interval with a 6 m distance between rows. The plantations were established through \u201chaschar\u201d (voluntary neighbourhood help) with 30 people planting about 10,000 trees within one month. During the first three years after planting the saplings need regular irrigation and sanitary cleaning to help establish themselves. After 6-7 years the trees start drawing a lot of water from the soil which prevents the irrigated soils from damage through water logging. Russian silverberry can grow up to 12 m in 10-12 years.\nBenefits of these shelterbelts are increased crop yields (wheat and rice) due to the protection from strong winds and decreased evapotranspiration. Thanks to the species association with nitrogen fixing root bacteria soil fertility is improved. The trees further produce edible fruits and provide valuable firewood that is consumed by the households. Russian Silverberry is resistant to pests and diseases and drought-tolerant once established; however, it requires a lot of water during the first few years. One constraint to the establishment of the shelterbelt is local people who often cut down branches for firewood. The farmer therefore has to guard his field whenever possible with the help of his family and staff he has employed to work on his field. Implementation of forestry initiatives began in 2009 and a total of 11 ha land was covered between 2009-2010. 11 farmers were involved in the project and establishment of the shelterbelts was initiated stage by stage during these two years. The project initiatives have also continued into 2011 as well. As other farmers do observe and understand the importance of shelterbelts, there has been a trend towards adoption of the technology by other farmers.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.09 km2.\nThe technology has been applied by 11 different farmers on 9 ha of landMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Dusty storms not only damage the crops but they also cause damage to the main surface, the fertile layer of soil.

Maize is a good example. For one hectare, a quantity of 20 kg of seeds is required. The planting configuration includes sowing at a distance of 40 cm within the rows and 80 cm between the rows, with a seeding depth of 3 to 5 cm, at a rate of 2 seeds per hole.\nShort-cycle varieties are used to adapt to climatic hazards, especially in areas with irregular rainfall cycles. The process of planting and maintenance comprises a series of tasks, including soil preparation, seed purchase, ploughing, maize seeding occurring two to four weeks before pigeon peas are sown. Subsequent steps involve weeding and hoeing\/ridging if necessary.\nShort-cycle varieties can yield in approximately 45 days, with a maximum timeframe of 80-90 days. In Benin, there is a list of short-cycle maize varieties, including BEMA14 J-07, BEMA14 J-08, BEMA14 J-15, BEMA00 J-20, BEMA14 B-09, BEMA14 B-10, EV DT 97 STR W, DMR ESR W BENIN, BEMA 94 B15, 2000 SYN EE W, and others.\nThe preference for early varieties among producers stems from their ability to expedite product maturation, a crucial factor in the current context characterized by climate change. For women in particular, short-cycle maize is a significant source of income. During these periods, they sell it fresh, cooked, or grilled. However, it should be noted that that each of these varieties comes with its own maintenance and input requirements, as well as their own production costs.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Genetic engineering and gene editing (CRISPR, etc.)|Nature-based solutions|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)","type_id":"993, 994, 995, 1196, 1199","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|Farm management|income increase|improved plant varieties|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|field management|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 918, 910, 1180, 902, 912, 914, 909","readiness_level":"9.

More specific objectives include: 1)protect the land from surface erosion by cutting slope length, increase infiltration and soil moisture; 2)to prevent soil loss of gentle slope farmland by allowing excess runoff to filter through but trapping sediment; 3) through the effect of tillage and water erosion between the strips, level bund lead to the formation of forward slope terraces over time, then developing into terrace final;4) creation of opportunities for additional income by harvesting fodder(grass) production and fruits(shrub).\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: A construction is generally carried out in autumn of the year; plantation is made in spring of the next year. The construction in a man-machine integration mode is generally carried out step by step and from top to bottom along the contour line(s). The ladder-shaped cross section of a ridge is 0.3-0.5m in width (suitable width on the top), 0.5-0.6m in height, 1:1 or 1:0.5 in inner-side gradient and 1:0.5 in outer-side gradient.\nIn a construction, peel the surface soil with machine, with the peeling depth generally being 0.3m, which should be subject to soil layer depth; then haul the ridge construction plough (a kind of machine or device) with a tractor to build the ridges, consolidate the ridges through artificial slapping; Finally restore the surface soil to accomplish ridge construction. The tops of the constructed ridges should be maintained to be in a horizontal surface. The distance between two ridges in this region is generally stipulated to be 50 meters. The soil for ridge construction should be free from such sundries as gravels, tree roots and turfs.\nNatural \/ human environment: Shrubbery buffer strip is found mainly in Northeast China, at altitudes between 700 and 1600 m. Climate there is cold in winters and cool in summers, with a monsoon moisture regime. In the area, the annual mean temperatures is from 2 to 8 \u00b0C, and the annual mean precipitation is from 500 to 1000 mm. Most of the farmland slopes are less than 7\u00b0but slope lengths  mainly range from 200 to 1000m in this area.\nNortheast China, the grain production base of China, or the bread basket of China, includes three provinces (Hei-long-jiang, Ji-lin, and Liao-ning) and the eastern part of the Inner Mongolian autonomous region. In 2009, 17.1% the China\u2019s total grain production came from this region, which included 33.5%, 55.7% and 9.6% of corn, soybean, and rice, respectively. Approximately 118 million people live in this region. Grain produced per capita is over 1000 kg annually.COMMENTS:This technique has been common applied in gentle slope farmland of the black soil region of Northeast China.

Due to overgrazing on highly erodible soils, gully headcuts are actively migrating upstream. Implementation of the technology leads to enhanced vegetation cover and reduced sediment transport in the gullies. Silt fences are temporary structures and are therefore placed closer together than permanent structures. The placing is such that the silt from the downstream structure builds up against the upstream structure to delay the perishing of the restoration materials. Vegetation must be established in the gully (donga) as soon as possible so that, when the materials decay after about ten years, the area will be restored.  Altitudes vary from 1 174 m to 780 m above sea level.  The reserve is located in a summer rainfall region and receives an average annual rainfall of 438 mm per year. Clayey duplex soils  are prone to both natural and man-induced erosion. The vegetation comprises Central Bushveld vegetation units of the Savanna Biome. Savanna is characterized by a herbaceous layer (usually dominated by grasses) with a woody component. In Southern Africa, Bushveld is an apt description of the vegetation structure, as the vegetation most often does not comprise distinct shrub and tree layers. Instead, the shrubs and trees occur in a matrix with a grass-dominated herb layer. A number of large gullies exist along drainage lines on highly erodible soils. Some of the gullies are up to 1.5 m deep and 5 m wide. A total of around 200 m of silt fences were erected at selected sites in the reserve to retain sediment and to establish vegetation. The following steps were followed in the establishment of the silt fences:\n1. Identification of priority sites to erect the silt fences - using Google Earth imagery and field surveys.\n2. Acquisition of restoration material and training of local community members on the implementation of the technology (training by Mr. Buckle at that stage from the Department).\n3.

After the collapse of the Soviet Era, many similar areas got degraded due to uncontrolled grazing and overuse of natural resources. The area described in this documentation, in contrast, was taken over by a family in 1991. Within the whole area of 40 ha, roads were built to improve the access and 6000 trees were planted, whereof 1200 fruit trees were planted on the pasture, conversing it into an orchard.\nAt present, the 6 ha of orchard are mainly consisting of three types of apple (white, golden and red), some pear and cherry trees. Several trees must have dried out or have been cut, as the farmer counts currently around 1000 fruit trees. The whole orchard is combined with pasture land. The farmer let his livestock graze in the orchard, and cuts the remaining grass in autumn, if there is still left.\nThe integrated orchard with pastureland and fodder production is partially fenced to hinder livestock entering his property. Furthermore, the orchard is within the range of vision which allows the farmer`s family to guard it.\nThe farmer who is managing the orchard today obtained the property of his father in order to continue the family project by his own initiative. By farming he ensures the livelihood of his family. Hence, he felt responsible to progress and improve the quality of life of his own family. The main reason for establishing the orchard within the grassland and to install fences, was to increase productivity of the land, bringin along beneficial effects on soil quality. According to his land users certificate, the main purpose of this land is to provide the local market with food products.\nAfter planting, some of the seedlings were stolen or eaten by livestock from neighbouring farms. Initial labour input in the newly established orchard consisted of getting and planting the seedlings and applying pesticides. The trees are being maintained by pruning. Soil is loosened and drainage provided to increase water infiltration and to protect the trees additionally from parasites. The pasture is grazed by the livestock of the farmer. As the family only has a small number of livestock, grass is cut afterwards and used as fodder. Half of the fodder harvest belongs to the hired worker, the other half belongs to the farmer. The other tasks are executed by the farmer and his family.\nThe climate is semi-arid with precipitation (800mm totally) mainly during winter and spring time. Altitude is around 1380 m asl. The plot is located at the foothill, with the wider riverbed and fan downstream and overgrazed hills upstream.

Occasionally grazed by cattle on an \u0022as needed\u0022 (ad hoc) basis.\nThe system aims to produce high quality nutrient-dense food, with the highest animal welfare, whilst simultaneously providing maximum biodiversity benefits. \nNew tree planting is protected by electric fencing comprising chestnut posts with ring insulators and poly wire, with cactus tree guards for individual trees. \nThe benefits include shelter and shade for animals, with increased diversity of forage. In time there will be a harvest of edible products for human consumption (fruits and nuts etc). And the system provides a variety of biodiversity benefits as well as a visual - aesthetic - improvement to the landscape.COMMENTS:Cefn Coch, Glaspwll, Machynlleth, SY20 8UASOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Animal management machinery|Digital technologies|Sensor|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Native species utilization|Species diversification","type_id":"993, 1188, 1195, 1015, 1036, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1201, 1200","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Farm management|field management|forestry management|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 916, 917, 910, 914, 927, 921, 918, 919, 922","readiness_level":"7.

The pasture in between the rows is mob grazed with young dairy stock.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Alan RadbourneBackground: The agroforestry system is part of a mixed farm of 630 hectares. 550 hectares are rented on a three generation tenancy. The farmer is the second generation. The trees are planted on the 80 hectares owned by the farmer. The annual rainfall for the region is approximatly 630mm per year with a typical temperate UK climate. The soil is heavy clay on a flat landscape.\nThe system: The field is 19 hectares. The trees are planted in rows which are 27 m apart. There is a main species in each row, planted at 10 m spacing.  These are inter-planted with smaller trees, or species that will be coppiced\/pollarded to maintain a small form. The main species are: Perry pear (a small pear that is a cross between Pyrus communis and its wild subsp. pyraster \u2013 used to make the alcoholic drink \u201cPerry\u201d). We have also some species planted for timber Quercus robur, Sorbus torminalis, Carpinus betula, Prunus avium. The inter-plant species are Salix various sp., Alnus glutinosa. These will be used either for animal fodder or for chipping and used as a mulch or for spreading on the land as soil health improver. There are also some Hippophae rhamnoides for human consumption. The alleys between the rows of trees are grazed by young dairy stock on a mob grazing rotational basis.\nAims: The aim is to improve soil and drainage in the field which is heavy clay. We hope to improve productivity but also have designed the system that we can grow crops in the future if we wanted to. The trees will also provide benefit to the cows through shelter and shade, and the inter-plants of willow and alder grow through diverse forage.\nTree protection: Fencing was our major challenge. There needed to be protection from the livestock but also from wildlife (in particular deer and hares). Our initial trial used individual guards and stakes but we have since fenced each side of each row with a single strand of electric fencing. This is working well.\nBenefits: This is newly planted but already we are seeing improvement in the grass ley through our rotational grazing. Water quality into the nearby stream and infiltration improved and flooding should also improve. We have seen an immediate increase in wildlife with greater numbers of hares, raptors (including kestrels, red kites and buzzards), and butterflies. The farm manager likes the ability to mob graze, although the system was complicated to set up. It is too early to comment on further benefits at this stage.COMMENTS:Eastbrook Farm, Bishopstone, Wiltshire, Helen Browning Organics\nLatitude 51.566424, Longitude 1.668787SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Species diversification|Integrated management systems|Mechanization|Vehicles and machinery|Animal management machinery","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1200, 1197, 1188, 1194, 1195","use_cases":"Production|animal production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|water use optimization for sustainability|livestock monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 910, 914, 916, 927, 921, 917, 918, 919, 922, 920, 905","readiness_level":"7.

La Finca California ha sido propiedad de la misma familia desde 1970. En aquel entonces, la producci\u00f3n de ganado se hac\u00eda convirtiendo los bosques en pastizales, eliminando o dejando muy pocos \u00e1rboles. En el a\u00f1o 1985 con el relevo generacional el Sr. Edwin Calvo, actual usuario de la tierra, inici\u00f3 de forma progresiva pr\u00e1cticas de manejo de ganader\u00eda con tendencia a la sostenibilidad. Ahora la finca cuenta con 60 animales que hacen rotaci\u00f3n en varios potreros con pastos mejorados y criollos africanos. Tambi\u00e9n se han implementado bancos mixtos de prote\u00edna y pastos de corte. El 2% del \u00e1rea de la finca est\u00e1 destinado a la conservaci\u00f3n de corredores de conectividad ecol\u00f3gica con las fincas vecinas y hacia las futuras \u00e1reas protegidas municipales de Perico y Laguna y el Santuario Nacional de Fauna y Flora de Los Colorados.\nEl sistema Silvopastoril fue implementado inicialmente en una hect\u00e1rea, en el a\u00f1o 2014. La tecnolog\u00eda combina una matriz de pastos con dominio de varias especies de braquiaria (Brachiaria spp.) con arbustos dispersos fijadores de nitr\u00f3geno y forrajeros (Leucaena leucocephala) .Para las divisiones de los potreros se usa cerca viva de pi\u00f1on (Jatropha curcas). Los principales insumos fueron semillas de pasto mejoradas, pl\u00e1ntulas de L. leucocephala, esquejes de pi\u00f1\u00f3n, abono org\u00e1nico y alambre. La tecnolog\u00eda se implement\u00f3 para contribuir a incrementar la productividad ganadera, mitigar los efectos de la estaci\u00f3n seca (4 meses) y reducir la degradaci\u00f3n del suelo (compactaci\u00f3n, erosi\u00f3n, disminuci\u00f3n de la humedad del suelo) causada por la ganader\u00eda en \u00e1reas de ladera. Gracias a la tecnolog\u00eda, la disponibilidad de forraje ha alcanzado 35 a 40 Ton\/ha\/a\u00f1o de pasto de corte, el cual puede ser cortado 3 o 4 veces por a\u00f1o. El pasto se mantiene verde a\u00fan en la estaci\u00f3n seca y ha permitido incrementar el n\u00famero de animales por hect\u00e1rea. El suelo tambi\u00e9n ha mejorado su porosidad, retenci\u00f3n de agua y contenido de materia org\u00e1nica. Adicionalmente, las cercas vivas han disminuido la tala de \u00e1rboles para postes que son necesarios en cercas convencionales.\nFinalmente, el Sr. Calvo, usuario de la tierra ha observado, que al tener el ganado alimento estable a lo largo del a\u00f1o, la producci\u00f3n de leche es mayor, los terneros est\u00e1n m\u00e1s sanos y el ganado tranquilo. Antes de la tecnolog\u00eda, la falta de alimento no solo afectaba la productividad del ganado; sino que tambi\u00e9n incrementaba los costos de manutenci\u00f3n de cercas.

Los usuarios de la tierra que establecen esta medida generalmente se siembran especies arb\u00f3reas nitrificantes como  Acacia macracantha (Faique), Erythrina edulis (porotillo), Caesalpinia spinosa (porotillo o tara), entre otras, que contribuyen al mejoramiento del suelo y con ello el crecimiento adecuado de los pastos y otras especies sembradas para la alimentaci\u00f3n del ganado. En este sistema se quiere una administraci\u00f3n de tal manera que perduren en el tiempo los \u00e1rboles, arbustos y los pastos, as\u00ed como su aprovechamiento en la alimentaci\u00f3n animal. La importancia de los mismos es que pueden aportar mucho en mantener una cobertura vegetal continua sobre el suelo, posiblemente haci\u00e9ndolo m\u00e1s f\u00e9rtil a mediano plazo. Esta medida es implementada con miras de mejorar la producci\u00f3n de alimento para ganado vacuno, tanto en cantidad como en calidad. La variabilidad en el clima y el cambio clim\u00e1tico son retos para la producci\u00f3n ganadera. Algunos productores dicen que ya no se sabe cu\u00e1ndo van a comenzar las lluvias. Esto es por la variabilidad en el clima. En algunos lugares del pa\u00eds hay menos agua que antes, tanto en los r\u00edos como menos frecuencia de lluvias, y esto ha llevado a una baja en la productividad. En a\u00f1os recientes, las sequ\u00edas han afectado la ganader\u00eda mucho m\u00e1s que en d\u00e9cadas anteriores. Los sistemas silvopastoriles pueden reducir el impacto del cambio clim\u00e1tico. Es importante mantener \u00e1rboles en la finca por varias razones: los animales necesitan sombra, especialmente las vacas lecheras. Durante las horas m\u00e1s calurosas del d\u00eda, los animales tienden a buscar la sombra de un \u00e1rbol para disipar calor. La segunda raz\u00f3n es porque pueden proveer ramas con forraje nutritivo para los animales lo que permite aumentar el rendimiento de leche por animal. Un beneficio adicional es que cuando dejamos que los \u00e1rboles crezcan, ellos utilizan carbono del aire para su estructura-tronco, ramas, ra\u00edces y hojas. A esto le llaman secuestrar carbono. Si se utilizan \u00e1rboles de tipo leguminosas, sus ra\u00edces tienden a mejorar el suelo. Esto se debe a su interacci\u00f3n con microorganismos llamados micorrizas que captan nitr\u00f3geno del aire y lo almacenan junto a las ra\u00edces de los \u00e1rboles.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1200, 1206","use_cases":"Production|animal production|livestock monitoring|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 905, 916, 918, 919, 921, 922, 917","readiness_level":"7.

Because of the slope and the cultivation it is mostly at risk during summer when there are tempests. To minimize the risk of soil and crop loss the land user decided to leave a part of the filed unemployed and planted a seam of grass and flowers to stabilize the soil. Whenever there is a rainfall event, the grass strip stops the flow of water and eroded top-soil and speed is reduced. Consequently, erosion is highly minimized and the damage to the field, crops and the street underneath stays small.\nPurpose of the Technology: The aim of the technology is to prevent erosion and soil loss, especially from heavy rainfall events during summer. Crop loss is also a consequence, so the land user loses not only top-soil and organic material but also crops and in the end money. The reduction of this high risk is the reason for the implementation of a grass strip on this problematic field.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: In the beginning seeds and a seeding machine were required. There is a specially designed mixture for field seams in Switzerland which the land user has to apply. After the first growing period the land user has to cut the grass with a special mowing machine. During the next two years the grass has to be cut every month. This is called the cleanup-cut. After the first two years the grass only needs to be cut twice a year. The grass must be led away.\nNatural \/ human environment: The most important conditions for this technology are a moderate slope on a field which is endangered by erosion through rainfall. The technology can stop and slow down the flow of water over the field to a neighbor field or onto the street and therefore minimize the risk and costs of soil loss and its consequences.COMMENTS:Comments:\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.0022 km2.\nThe total SLM Technology area is 22 areMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Run-off during rainfall causes often much soil erosion because of the many slopes in this area. As a consequence of erosion there is soil loss and within this also loss of fertility of the soil.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): The intensification of agricultural fields is the main problem for the land user. Through a intensely use of the soils the risk for erosion increases. However, one must always also do as much as possible for protecting endangered fields of part of it. This is the solution.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|disaster management|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 910, 914, 1154, 918, 922, 917","readiness_level":"7.

The technology is easy to apply and efficient to mitigate erosion processes of the upper soil layer and to stop small rock falls.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Hanns KirchmeirIn the provinces of Aragatsotn and Shirak in Armenia, the weather is cold and temperate with dry summer. Steep slopes, pastures and some autochthonous oak forests make up the area. Farmers make most of their income with grazing by manual labour. The carrying capacity of pastures in the vicinity is regularly exceeded, and they degrade more and more. In order to stabilize the steep eroded slopes, pile walls were established. Pile walls are horizontal constructions along a slope, functioning as erosion control measures by slowing down the superficial water runoff, retaining materials and supporting the rehabilitation of vegetation.\nThe major advantages are: It is not expensive since mostly locally available materials can be used, and a positive effect can already be observed within a year. Also, the pile walls can be established relatively easy without any need of heavy machinery or specific knowledge and, therefore, allow the involvement of the local population.\nIn the case of the implementation in Armenia, the exact location for the pilot measures was selected in such a way that grazing activities were almost not impaired. For temporary exclusion of livestock, electric fencing was used. Within the fenced area, pile walls were established in the washed-out rills along the slope to address the water erosion phenomena.\nThe technical requirements and workload for the construction of a pile wall are relatively low. The needed resources require iron piles, a hammer, wooden logs (or a bundle of branches) and tree cuttings. First, the wooden logs were cut in 1-2 m length to fit into the irregular rills of the slope. After identifying the locations of individual pile walls, the team fixed the logs with iron poles of about 70-100cm length. The distance between the pile walls varies between 1-3m, depending on the topography: the steeper the slope, the closer the distance. The space behind the logs was filled with soil, plant material and rocks to stabilize the construction and to reduce the risk of water washing out the soil and passing below the logs. As a last step, the terraces were covered with hay to provide protection against precipitation and to accelerate re-growth of grass through the seeds contained in the hay residuals.\nCommunity members were surprised how easy and quick the pile walls could be established. A team of two workers established a pile wall within 30 min. Since these areas are usually intensively used and thus are of high importance for the community, even a temporary exclusion from use must be thoroughly discussed and agreed upon.\nThe measure slows down vertical water-run off and provides steps for cattle. Due to temporary fencing and the application of hay mulch vegetation is recovering on these parts.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production","use_cases_id":"916, 922, 918, 921, 910, 914, 897, 1186, 899","readiness_level":"7.

The shape of the constructed wetlands can differ and include different components. Generally, they include a deeper sedimentation pond at the inlet (depth 1.5-2 m), followed by one or more shallow vegetated zones (depth 0.5 m). The sedimentation pond decreases the water velocity to allow particles to settle, while the vegetated, shallower zones act as filters for particles passing the sedimentation pond and protect trapped sediments from re-suspension by stabilizing them with their roots.\nSmall constructed wetlands treating agricultural runoff have been in operation in Norway since the early 1990s. From 1994-2020, more than 1200 CWs have been established across the country, with the aim of reducing sediment, nutrients, pesticides and other pollutants in agricultural runoff. \nEstablishment\/maintenance: Norwegian CW are designed mainly to remove phosphorus and particles (suspended sediment) with main removal mechanism being sedimentation and filtration, and (to a lesser extent) plant uptake.  The CWs treating agricultural runoff are usually constructed by expanding the width of natural streams. At the inlet of the CW, the stream water flows into a sedimentation pond. From the sedimentation pond, water passes through a sprinkling zone, and then through one or more vegetated wetland filters.

The height ranges from 994 -1,100 m above sea level (m asl). The main river is Mae La Noi. The climate is cool all year round. The annual average temperature is 25 degrees Celsius (\u2070C), maximum temperature is 37\u2070C in April, and minimum temperature is 8\u2070C during December. The annual average rainfall is 1,500 mm and lasts from June to October. The number of households is 147, with total population of approx 763, 400  (Mae La Noi Royal Project Development Center, 2561). An irrigation distribution system to highland rice terraces is required for agriculture on these highland slopes. It is based on the principles of water management in the area by diversion of water from natural watersheds in the upstream areas to the agricultural land - with regulation by village community consensus. The steps of preparation are as follows. 1. Site selection: Rice terraces should be on suitable slopes, not more than 60 degrees, otherwise it will be di\ufb03cult to excavate the slope and rice \ufb01elds become very narrow. 2. Reshaping and leveling the slope: The sloping land for rice terrace should be reshaped and levelled by either manpower or mechanical means. The terraces can extend up to 50 m long, be as little as 1 m wide and 0.5 m deep, depending on the slope. The leveling of soil surface in the plot is done by releasing water into that plot and adjust the soil surface until a good level is attained. 3. Soil improvement: Generally, soil structure and fertility in the plots is very low because of reshaping and leveling. It is therefore necessary to restore and improve by application of organic matter, compost, animal manure, legumes, etc. Soil pH must be adjusted, and nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium should be added based on soil analytical results. 4. Rice cultivation: In the \ufb01rst years of cultivation, the terraces may not store water at the desired level, so rice is planted in small holes. Normally, farmers plant rice seedlings (3-5 seedlings per hole) at a spacing of 20 x 20 cm. 5. Fertilizer application: In this highland area focus should be on organic fertilizers to reduce costs, because people can \ufb01nd materials locally such as animal manure and plant residues. 6. Water supply system: Distribution of water to the rice terraces is managed by small dams or weirs to release suitable amount of water through a small water channel to rice terraces. This water distribution system will spread water to all land users in this area, and there is su\ufb03cient water for farming throughout the year. 7. Disease and insect control: Most rice varieties are native, so they have high resistance. But there could be some disease\/insect outbreaks; they have to be protected according to instructions. The submerged condition in the paddy \ufb01eld can help control weeds, but some labour is still needed. 8. Maintenance: For small dams or weirs, small water channels and terraces, it is necessary to restore and maintain twice a year, i.e. before and after harvest.COMMENTS:Farmers in the area will grow rice in the rainy season for household consumption. The duration of cultivation until harvesting is about 6 months. In the dry season, the farms are converted to several kind of vegetables under support by the Royal Project Foundation.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 921, 920, 912, 908, 909","readiness_level":"7.

The climate is humid and tropical, with 1,700-2,000 mm of rainfall annually. The main aim of the terraces is to facilitate cultivation of tea or coffee on sloping land: erosion control is secondary. Coffee and tea, as well as flowers and vegetables, are good alternatives to opium poppies - which it is government policy to eradicate.\nPurpose of the Technology: After clearing natural and secondary forests by slash and burn, terraces are aligned by eye - and constructed by hoe. The width of the bed is 1.0-1.5 m depending on slope, though there are no specific technical guidelines. The length of each terrace can be up to 25 m. Down the slope, after every 3-4 terraces, there are lateral drainage channels, approximately 20-30 cm wide and 10 cm deep. Situated at the foot of a riser, each channel has a gradient of 0.5% or less. Excess water - some of which cascades over the terrace risers, with some draining through the soil - is discharged through these channels, generally to natural waterways. The risers are steep, with a slope of above 100%, and without a defined lip.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Natural grass cover develops on the risers: this is cut back by hand hoe or machete, or completely removed. The grass is often burned. After harvest (of annual crops), the land is left until immediately before the next rainy season. The terraces at this stage are covered by weeds and grasses. Land is then tilled by hoe. The weeds and grasses are removed and heaped in piles outside the cropped area. They are not composted or used for mulching - and here an opportunity is missed. Where soil fertility is a problem, chemical fertilizers are used. Maintenance includes building up\/repairing of risers and levelling of terrace beds as required.\nNatural \/ human environment: The technology was pioneered, and continues to be practiced, by refugee immigrants from China looking for new areas to start farming. These immigrants first came in the 1950s, and cultivated simply through slash and burn techniques. During the 1970s they visited relatives in Taiwan and brought back the idea of small terraces. Originally they settled illegally, but eventually they were given official permission to stay. However, official title deeds to their land have not yet been allocated.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 5 km2.\nThis practice has been done by tribal people such as E-kaw, Lahu, Lisu, Mien, Khin, Thai Yai, Haw Chinese, H\u0027mongMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): - soil erosion on cultivated hillsides\n- practical difficulties in tending tea, coffee, vegetables and flowers on sloping land: farming is much easier on levelled land\n- Lacking of land ownership (The whole area is reserved forest.)\n- Low price of agricultural produce.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): 1.

The spacing is approximately 0.5 m from pit centre to pit centre within lines and 1.0 m between lines. During excavation soil is normally heaped below each pit. The spaces between pits are not cultivated. Pits are made during the land preparation period, before the rains. Planting millet seed in the pits follows. Part of the excavated soil is returned to cover the seed, but a depression remains to permit water harvesting. Sungula has a stick \u2013 that he shows to visitors - with which he measures depth. Construction of contour bunds to control runoff from outside the plot is carried out in places. There is no strict design, as the farmer is still testing various types. The contour bunds protect the pits (which partially fill with sediment during the season) from excess runoff, and minimise soil erosion.\nPurpose of the Technology: The primary purpose is to improve crop production. In terms of soil and water conservation, the moisture status in the soil is raised through water harvesting. Simultaneously, sheet erosion is controlled.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Pits are generally desilted on an annual basis, but new ones are only constructed, in spaces between the original pits, after a few years. Maintenance is also required for the bunds between the pits.\nNatural \/ human environment: Kenneth Sungula and his family are dependent on his 4 hectares of gently sloping land in Chololo2 village. The family own no livestock, other than a few chickens. They grow millet and cowpeas as their main annual crops. Neither Sungula nor his wife are literate. His novel technology dates back to 1978,\nwhen Sungula stumbled upon the idea by accident. He noted that some plants growing in a small depression in the ground were strongly outperforming others nearby. He then began to experiment by deliberately creating small planting pits. Sungula claims that \u2018his stomach taught him\u2019 how to make the pits. His meaning is clear: hunger drove him to find a more productive system of production. These chololo pits, named after the local village, hold runoff, and the spaces between the pits act as micro-catchments.

Ponds contain limited or no water during dry weather, but are designed to retain water during rain events.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Dominika KrzeminskaThe aim of the small retention ponds is to provide additional storage capacity to hold runoff to attenuate surface runoff - and thus reduce its impact on flooding - during rainfall events. The measure will primarily be useful in connection with short-term extreme episodes and have less effect during prolonged rain \u2013 this is because once the dam is filled up it no longer has a flood-reducing effect.\nSmall retention ponds located in forest areas are artificial dams (up to 2m height, for security reasons) made of soil, stone and\/or gabions, with additional storage capacity to attenuate surface runoff during rainfall events. The ponds use local topography to provide space to store discharge peaks. The size of the ponds vary greatly  between c. 50-150 m3. The dams can either be established in waterways, or next to the stream so that water is diverted during a flood event. Continuous water flow through the dam is ensured by a spillway located at the bottom of the dam. In this way, the dam can temporarily store water during rainfall episodes and thus decrease the flood peak downstream. The pond must be designed correctly, and calculations of cost-benefit should be carried out before implementation. \nAs for now, the implementation of small retention ponds in the forests are initiated by landowners. The ponds are getting more and more interest from the local communities however, they are not yet commonly implemented. \nIn general, there is agreement between experts (researchers) and other stakeholders about the benefits of the implementation of small retention ponds in the forest. However, it is not always the case that such retention ponds decrease floods -  as the level of influence depends on the scale and the number of ponds within the catchment. When it comes to drawbacks, stakeholders were particularly worried about the cost of building and maintaining the retention ponds as well as the security of the construction. They placed less emphasis on possible decreases in forest production, which was one of the disadvantages identified by researchers. \nInformation about the technology is based on investigations and\/or reports from different catchments in Norway. For the purpose of the OPTAIN project, the technology is further presented in the natural and human environment context of the Kr\u00e5kstad River catchment - a Norwegian Case Study catchment within the OPTAIN project.  \nThe Kr\u00e5kstad River is mainly situated in Ski municipality in South-Eastern parts of Norway. The river catchment is a western tributary of the Vansj\u00f8-Hob\u00f8l watercourse, also known as the Morsa watercourse. The Kr\u00e5kstad River catchment area is about 51 km\u00b2, 43% of which is agricultural land, where cereals are produced on heavy clay soils. The main environmental challenge in the area is water quality (incl. high phosphorus pollution) and soil erosion (incl. riverbank erosion and quick-clay landslides).The Morsa watercourse is a drinking water resource and there are specific environmental regulations for land management followed by subsidies through the Regional Environmental Programme (RMP).COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204","use_cases":"Farm management|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"910, 1154, 916, 920, 918, 921","readiness_level":"7.

In Northern Uganda, this technology involves several goats, raised in a shade constructed often of wooden materials. An average shade covers about 10 m by 2.5 m, and raised up to 0.5 m off the ground to protect the ruminants from vermin such as snakes and rats, as well as rainwater flooding. The ground floor may be cemented so that the droppings are kept free from mixing with other pesticides and various chemicals used to control external parasites that may contaminate the manure. The droppings generated by the animals are collected from underneath the shade and heaped in a pit for composting. The pit is covered for about two weeks using a grass and soil or polythene paper. After this period, the compost manure is mature and is ready for application in the fields to increase production. Because this technology involves goats, it is relatively easier and cheaper to maintain than the case of cattle in terms of feeding and maintenance.  Besides, it is more efficient in providing manure for soil fertility improvement since the droppings generated by the animals are collected from underneath the shade and heaped in a pit for composting and collected over time. Moreover, the demand for goat meat is often high, thus its price remains steadily high during the year.  To be able to manage this technology and to achieve desired benefits, the farmer must keep in contact with the extension worker for veterinary services because goat diseases are rampant in the region and vary from simple skin ailments, diarrhoea to severe conditions causing, loss of weight, abortion and death. The most common infections include; Scours that are more common in young goats and dirty pens caused by bacteria, coccidia, worms or even showing the following signs; loss of appetite, diarrhoea (yellow to red discoloration), pasting of faeces under and around the tail, loss of weight and high temperature. Goats are well known for their strength and resilience to diseases. However, this does not necessarily mean that they are never affected. This often accounts for a substantial part of the cost of production.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Animal management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1195, 1196, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal health|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|income increase|livestock monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 1186, 907, 916, 921, 910, 1180, 905","readiness_level":"7.

This is practiced by a farmer who effectively utilized a swamp by constructing a relatively small water reservoir for watering  pastures during dry season to ensure continuous pasture production all year around.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  PRISCILLA VIVIAN KYOSABASmall scale irrigation system for pasture production is the artificial supply of water to areas for agricultural use; in this case water is supplied to pasture land. It\u2019s practiced by a cattle farmer in Kyegwemera Village Kyegegwa District in western Uganda who effectively utilized the swamp by constructing a relatively small water reservoir for watering pastures during the dry season to ensure continuous pasture production all year round.\nThis irrigation project was initiated and partially financed  by the local government and is used as training ground for the various farmer groups interested in adoption of the technology; as technical guidance in popularizing farmer-managed smallholder irrigation systems. Also training of district staff members and other stakeholders in irrigation technology, the sustainable utilization and management of wetlands. More so, the monitoring and evaluation progress in irrigation activities in liaison with district specialists also increases development of this technology  and its adoption in the district.\nWith support from local government, the farmer was able to construct the irrigation site to boost pasture production for his 9 dairy cattle grazed on the farm. The irrigation water reservoir has a size of 25 feet long by 10 feet wide of his total land area of 22 acres. The water reservoir has a holding capacity of approx. 25.000 liters.\nThis system has a small pump with the capacity of 25000 litres\/h and is able to irrigate up to 5 hectares. The motorized pump is used to pump water from the swamp into an open water reservoir which is later pumped or supplied to the pastures. The water is also used for drinking for the animals.\nFrom the irrigated fields, fodder yields are stable and reliable to meet production targets hence reduced fluctuations in year-to-year yields and reduced pasture failure during drought. With this system yields from irrigated pastures are expected to increase up to two to three (2-3) time\u2019s higher hence increased pasture yield. In addition, irrigation enhances continuous cultivation due to available irrigation equipment like pumps and other ancillary equipment.\nEstablishment of the irrigation system cost two million seven hundred seventy thousand shillings only (2,770,000=); for reservoir construction labor, spade, bricks, sand, clay, fuel, servicing frequent pump breakdown, construction cement, water proof cement and generator. The system is simple to install and easy to use. The small-scale irrigation project addresses problems that have been caused by both severe and recurring drought and increasing desertification. However, majority of farmers are illiterate and lack basic knowledge of water requirements, irrigation scheduling, skills in maintaining and operating the pumps. This affects yields, as crops are either over or under-irrigated, leading to wastage of the little available water. Erosion is also a serious problem during the rainy season in addition to continuous cultivation and reduced fertility issues.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|Farm management|disaster management|field management|livestock monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 1186, 916, 920, 918, 910, 1154, 914, 905","readiness_level":"7.

It is a small-scale form of vegetable growing that includes a compost heap, and several plots or divided areas of land intended to grow one or more types of plants in each plot. Plots may also be divided into rows with an assortment of vegetables grown in those different rows. It is usually located in back gardens.\nThis practice can be carried out by anyone willing to invest some time every day to nurture the plants. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of money or time. Backyard gardening provides fresh and nutritious fruits and vegetables having a higher nutrient content than vegetables that have traveled several hundreds of miles to markets. The technology uses family labour which is readily available and relatively cheap compared to hired labour.\nThe activities involved in establishing such a technology include (1) clearing area where vegetables will be grown, (2) buying seed (3) weeding (4) acquiring pesticides, if required to spray the garden. Scarcity of water during the dry season may affect production while litter from plant material can increase productivity in the short run.\nInputs required for establishing such a technology include: labour, seed, hoes and panga. With this technology a farmer reported establishing the garden on an area size of 10 x 24 meters. Various vegetable varieties were planted in different specified plots. The farmer reported to have used UGX 208,100\/= two hundred eight thousand one hundred shillings only.\nVegetable gardening is becoming more popular both as a part time job and as a source of income. One of the most important aspects needed for this practice is water, which makes up 90 percent of a plant\u2019s weight. However, watering is a heavy and difficult job so the farmer established her garden near her house in the compound making access and watering easier.\nHome gardening offers an opportunity to reduce the amount of pesticides used because plant and pest control can be tighter close to homesteads. Gardening increases physical activity. It is a great way to engage the whole family in physical activity and take responsibility for the garden. Vegetables grown in homegardens will promote health because they are rich in nutrients, especially in phytochemicals, anti-oxidants, vitamin C plus A and foliate.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Frugal innovation|Social and socio-economic|Low-cost farming tools and techniques","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206, 1088, 1076, 1089","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|improved plant varieties|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|minimize pesticide use|Alternative food production|production of food in limited spaces (e.g. vertical farming)|Supply chain management|support to consumption and nutrition","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 902, 915, 916, 921, 926, 934, 935, 939, 944","readiness_level":"9.

KiharaLaikipia District in Kenya is characterised by a semi-arid climate, high altitude and rolling terrain. Most of the soil and water loss occurs during a few heavy storms at the beginning of each growing season. More than 90% of families have under two hectares of land, and few have alternative sources of income.\nThe form of conservation agriculture described in this case study involves the use of ox-drawn ploughs, modified to rip the soil. Ripping is performed in one pass, to a depth of 10 cm, after harvest. Spacing between the rip lines is 30 cm - in the case of wheat. Deep ripping (subsoiling) with the same implement is done, when necessary, to break a plough pan and reaches depths of up to 30 cm. An adaptation to the ordinary plough beam (the common mouldboard \u2018Victory\u2019 plough) makes adjustment to different depths possible and turns it into a ripper for surface and deeper ripping.\nThe aim of ripping is to increase water infiltration and reduce runoff. In contrast to conventional tillage, the soil is not inverted, thus leaving a certain amount of crop residue on the surface. As a result, the soil is less exposed and not so vulnerable to the impact of splash and sheet erosion, and water loss through evaporation and runoff. In addition, there are savings in terms of energy used for cultivation. In well-ripped fields, rainfall from storms at the onset of the growing season is stored within the rooting zone, and is therefore available to the crop during subsequent drought spells. Ripping the soil during the dry season combined with a mulch cover reduces germination of weeds, leaving fields ready for planting. In case of stubborn weeds, pre-emergence herbicides are used for control. Yields from small-scale conservation tillage can be more than 60% higher than under conventional ploughing. An additional important benefit is that crops mature sooner in conservation agriculture, because they can be planted earlier: under inversion tillage the farmer has to wait for the soil to become moist before ploughing. Earlier crop maturity means access to markets when prices are still high.\nThere are various supportive technologies in use which can improve the effectiveness of the ripping. These include: (1) use of compost\/manure to improve soil structure for better water storage; (2) use of a cover crop (eg Mucuna pruriens) planted at the end of the season to prevent erosion, control weeds and improve soil quality; (3) agroforestry: principally Grevillea robusta planted on the field boundaries (see also \u2018Grevillea agroforestry system\u2019).COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 4 km2.\nExpert judgement and group (Mwireri, Kieni, Kalalu villages in Umande sub-district) discussionTrees\/ shrubs species: Grevillea robusta\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Loss of rainwater through runoff and direct evaporation from soil surface, runoff causing surface erosion, fertility decline due to erosion and nutrient mining\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Declining rainfall leading to reduced or no yields.  The need to add fertiliser to achieve good yields.\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: Monocrop wheat (March-August) followed by beans\/potatoes (Oct-Dec).  Maize has a longer growivng season and usually harvested in November but will be intercropped with beans and potatoes (see annex T3).  Occasional herbicide usage eg in wheat, 2,4-D is used to control weeds prior to canopy cover.  Wheat is mixed with fertiliser prior to planting.  Fertiliser placement for all crops is adjacent to seed.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 921, 897, 898, 920, 918, 909, 910, 914, 912, 926","readiness_level":"7.

Small-scale dams impound permanent or seasonal water behind them, covering areas from 5 to 15 hectares. They are built with buttresses and a stilling basin. Depending on local conditions, the dam wall can be made of quarry stone joined with mortar or concrete. The dikes are made of earth and can be reinforced with stones. Some such structures are built as bridge dams, providing a means of crossing the valley. The effect on the water table depends on the depth at which the dam is anchored. The deeper the foundation, the more groundwater is retained. Sometimes, they are fitted with geomembranes which extend down deeper to retain more groundwater.\nIn the rainy season, water gradually accumulates behind the dike, increasing the availability of surface water during the rainy season and groundwater in the dry season. The land is farmed upstream and downstream both in the rainy season and the dry season. During the rainy season, rice is grown, and the areas around the body of water are used for other crops (flood-recession  cropping). Dams increase the area of farmable land, yields and production. The water is also used for livestock, for fish farming and sometimes for household needs. The recharged water table feeds market garden wells, enabling farmers to grow vegetables in the dry season and permitting two or three crop harvests a year which increases the availability of food, providing income for farmers and guaranteeing work all year round. This improves the stability of local communities, increases their income and raises their standard of living.\nSustainable operation and management depend directly on the participatory approach. At the planning stage, the condition of the valley upstream and downstream and all user groups must be taken into account. The question of land tenure, in particular, must be settled before construction begins. It must be determined who the owner of the bottomlands is, who will be entitled to use them once the dam has been constructed, what uses will be permitted and under what conditions. The question of project ownership and upkeep must also be clarified. Today, the role of project owner is normally assigned to the commune authorities, although management of the dam is often delegated to a management committee. In order to avoid conflicts, it is essential to take into account all the user groups, livestock keepers in particular. Watering corridors must be established to prevent animals from damaging the crops. In order to maximise the value of the investment, well-organised management committees must be set up to ensure efficient crop production and oversee maintenance work. A management committee controls the opening and closing of the gates. It organises the maintenance of the structure and the implementation of any additional measures necessary to protect the gabion structures and stone bunds. It also collects and manages funds for the maintenance of the dam and organises meetings of farmers. In dry periods, it is important to manage water resources in such a way that downstream areas have enough water. When a series of dams are built on the same watercourse, an inter-dam committee may be required to manage the distribution of water and avoid conflicts between the users of the different dams.\nWell-constructed small-scale dams last at least 50 years with a certain amount of upkeep. A high standard of technical planning and construction is required for small-scale dams to avoid subsequent damage. Depending on the natural characteristics of the watershed, small-scale dams may require additional SWC\/SPR measures upstream to protect them from siltation.\nThese small-scale dams are suitable for use in narrower valleys, as a considerable volume of water can be impounded with a relatively short structure. They are not as well suited to wide, gently sloping valleys, as very long dikes are required and this increases the cost.COMMENTS:Small-scale dams impound permanent or seasonal water behind them, covering areas from 5 to 15 hectaresMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): lack of irrigation water, surface water, soil erosion by water and wind\nConstraints of common grazing land\nConstraints of forested government-owned land or commonsSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Traditional and indigenous practices|Institutional|Governance function|Inclusive decision-making processes in agriculture","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1204, 1206, 1116, 1129, 1131","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|fisheries products management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|optimization of resource use for better production|disaster management|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 1186, 900, 916, 920, 921, 910, 914, 1180, 912, 909, 1154, 918","readiness_level":"9.

Risks of relative shortages are likely to increase due to climate change. Simultaneously there are many discarded by-products from (local) agrofood supply chains such as olive cakes, date kernels, and downgraded dates, which contain good levels of nutrients. ICARDA saw an opportunity and, together with local partners, a machine was imported that is able to compress nutritious by-products into pellets. In addition to the machine, ICARDA and OEP experimented with feasible inputs and di\ufb00erent ratios, considering local availability as well. It achieved highly dense and nutritious feed pellets from local available inputs, with similar quality to the imported pellets. There are currently two pelletizers on the market, a large model with a maximum capacity of 500 kilograms of pellets per hour, and a more a\ufb00ordable small pelletizer producing 125 kilogram per hour. Four formulae are recommended (see section 4.1).  Two have olive cake as the main ingredient and the other two have date palm by-products as the key input.

The prototype, designed and tested with input from a local manufacturer, is suitable for the primary field crops (such as wheat, barley, vetch, and faba beans) in Tunisia. The machine sort out damaged or small seeds and rock or pebbles, while treating the remaining seeds by removing contamination or weeds, to ensuring quality and longer shelf-life.\nThe mobile seed cleaning machine, with a capacity of approximately 800 kilograms per hour depending on the seed type, was distributed to four farmer cooperatives, serving a total of 1,000 small-scale farmers. In order to promote ownership, the farmers contributed to a portion of the costs and received training on how to operate the machine effectively.\nWhen using the mobile seed cleaning machine, farmers have the option to choose between two methods: solely cleaning the seeds or cleaning and treating them. The cost for cleaning alone is around 2 Tunisian Dinar per 100 kilograms, while the cost for both cleaning and treating, which includes the application of a fungicide, is 8 Tunisian Dinar per 100 kilograms. Life time is estimated between 5 and 10 years and worn out parts can easily be replaced.\nThe introduction of the mobile seed cleaning machine has several advantages, including a decrease in workload for women and children, improved production and quality of crops, higher productivity of the land, reduced dependence on imported seeds and machinery, and the promotion of local value chains and social cohesion through cooperative ownership and utilization of the machines.\nHowever, there are still some challenges to overcome. For example, the initial prototype required heavy bags of seeds to be lifted to a height of two meters, leading to additional labour requirements and reduced efficiency. This challenge was addressed by equipping the machine with a conveyor screw, which can double its capacity at an additional cost. Additionally, the cost of purchasing the machine can be a significant investment for farmers, but this can be overcome through collective buying and organizing themselves in cooperatives.\nIn conclusion, the mobile seed cleaning machine represents an innovative solution that improves the (local) value chain and livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Tunisia by reducing workload and costs, particularly for women and children. This technology has the potential to be scaled up and benefit other regions and cooperatives.\nICARDA\u2019s work on Small-Scale Seed Cleaning Unit is supported by the CGIAR Research Program on Livestock, the IFAD-Funded CLCA Project, the GIZ SWC@Scale project as part of the ProSol global program, and the CGIAR initiative on Agroecology in Collaboration with National Partners in Tunisia and Algeria (OEP-Tunisia, IRESA-Tunisia, INRAT Tunisia, ITGC-Algeria, GIZ Tunisie, DGACTA-Tunisie)COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Harvesting and processing equipment|Vehicles and machinery|Digital technologies|Mobile app|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1192, 1194, 1015, 1032, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|Farm management|equipment management|optimization of resource use for better production|field management|Collective action and aggregation|cooperative management to improve efficiency and governance|shared economy support to share equipment and reduce individual costs|support to collective selling to access larger markets","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 910, 913, 909, 914, 973, 974, 977, 976","readiness_level":"7.

The pit has a double function: it is the place where manure is produced and it serves as shed for small ruminants (goats, sheep), particularly to avoid uncontrolled grazing \/browsing during the cropping season (from April until November). Animals are fed in the fosse, and they drop their faeces, which together with chopped organic material accruing from the kitchen and field activities, piles up in the pit for decomposition. The fosse is partly roofed to provide optimal micro-climatic conditions: partial shading, partial exposure to sunlight and appropriate moistening through rainfall. Inside the pit, one or more circular terraces (0.5 m high, 0.5 m wide) serve as resting area for the animals. The terrace riser need to be plastered or reinforced with stones, particularly in case of loose soil, to avoid damage caused by animal trampling. After decomposition the manure is removed from the pit and distributed on the fields beginning of each cropping season (March). Then straw bedding is renewed and the process starts from scratch.

The tool as applied secures tenure through the recognition of tenure diversity and social contexts. In the management of land and resources use, STDM facilitates proper land use and management to minimize practices that lead to degradation.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Ken OtienoTechnology application: The Social Tenure Domain Model is applied in order to relate natural and human environments. It is a social tool that defines the relationship of persons to natural resources such as land, their utilization of it, and sharing - for sustainable development. To realize optimal resource utilization, the tool enables the direct engagement of the resource users in a collective and participatory way. The technology allows communities to be part of a guided data collection and data entry into an STDM platform. The data includes social and economic data based on what is needed. The platform also can enable storage of information and documents such as title deeds. Names, gender, properties where the community members needs to have such information. These details can be updated and can inform planning and resource allocation by government and development partners.    Main characteristics of the technology: STDM is a relational database built on an open source GIS platform called Quontum GIS (QGIS), running on Postgres SQL. This tool was built by Global Tools Land Network (GLTN). The tool captures both spatial information related to locations of land parcels, natural resources captured in points and defined in maps. Secondly, the technology captures socio-economic aspects of a resource, and allows definition of the type of relationship that exists between the resource and the person, as well as an indication of the percentage particular tenure regime in the areas including the existing rights and how they play out. The system recognizes the different level of rights thus appreciating that they are multiple and overlaid resulting to multiple uses. Therefore the technology enables the capture of bundles of rights that people have\/should enjoy in a resource. The technology allows generation of reports and performs the desired analysis by the proponents and the beneficiaries of the information stored within the databases. It is open source, thus available free -hence its sustainability.The purposes\/ functions of the STDM: The functions of the technology as have been piloted by RECONCILE and partners has focused around land tenure. It addresses security of tenure for vulnerable poor communities living within informal settlements, through participatory common resource identification, mapping and documentation, key resources including cattle dips, salt lick areas\/fields and water points management has improved. This is due to the recognition of boundaries anticipatorily defined leading to revival of and establishment of community resources management committees especially around water and grazing lands. This in return has improved \/increased production of both plants and animals. However, the technology can be customized to serve other purposes of information storage and management. The major activities\/ inputs needed to establish\/ maintain the technology: Major inputs are needed in empowerment of local communities through building their capacity to apply the technology through their own initiative. Building community-based resource centres and equipping them with computers installed with the software ensures that the technology is centred on the day-to-day activities of the communities and institutions. Benefits\/ impacts: The technology has left better organised communities in terms of managing land and other resources. The technology has assisted local governments to manage issues of land ownership, especially within the context of customary land tenure and ownership. The county governments of Kenya, for instance, have spatial data and information that can help in planning and resources allocation. In areas where the technology has been used in the context of RECONCILE\u0027s work, better services and resources can be acquired given accurate information of Mapping land tenure, boundaries, water points and the water rights, infrastructure, different grazing lands and plans for the utilization of the grazing land and the rights of different users. It can result in improved and sustainable use of natural resources which in turn have a direct impact on production. Small-scale dairy farmers have been able to manage grazing lands, water and salt licks to improve production of animal products. Information captured and managed by the technology has enabled communities within informal settlements to negotiate with government authorities to enable land allocation and thus security of tenure and improved livelihoods.What do land users like \/ dislike about the technology?Likes: The technology is flexible, it can be customized to capture information in any form desired. It is based on a GIS platform which is easy to manipulate and is open source.Dislikes: Users sometimes encounter errors that are a result of incorrect information entered, and these errors are written with the programming format: thus it requires good knowledge of the technology to remedy this.COMMENTS:The technology is applicable in both. It can be customized to fit any use. The best outcome though is total area social enumeration and spatial mapping.Main animal species and products: The cattle kept in Ndaraweta are mainly cross-breeds between local animals and Friesian or Ayrshire cattle. The communities are currently in an advance stage of upgrading, but they still keep some short-horned local zebu cows as well. The cattle are kept for multiple uses including milk, meat, and hides. The communities grow hay for local use and sale within.\nThe technology did therefore help the communities to appreciate the common resources that support the livestock keeping.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies|Desktop\/web-based application|GIS|Geospatial technologies|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement|Institutional|Governance function|Knowledge management function","type_id":"993, 1015, 1023, 1027, 1052, 1076, 1091, 1116, 1129, 1123","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|optimization of resource use for better production|field management|Farm management|livestock monitoring|record-keeping and accounting|biodiversity mapping to inform land use planning","use_cases_id":"916, 897, 899, 1186, 909, 914, 910, 905, 911, 924","readiness_level":"7.

Soil bunds are suitable for steeper slopes compared to fanya juu terraces which are more effective in gentle and flatter slopes.Land users in the SWC area prefer to combine the two physical structures for many reasons.One important factor is the cost of establishment, which is a function of labour needed for the construction. Fanya juu which means throwing soil upslope in Kiswahili intails throwing soil upslope which is more labours than throwing soil to downslope in the case of soil bunds. The other reason is that cultivated lands with fanya juu terraces are not easily accessed by free grazing livestock. The ditches placed in the downslope side of the embankment (fanya juu) is not easily vrossable but in soil bund although not that easy livestock are seen to trample over the embankment and jump the ditch which is placed in the upslope side. The other advantage farmers consider is that Fanya juu is more efficient in controlling runoff because the water that overtops the embankment is trapped by the ditch. Fanya Juu despite its high cost is preferred to be applied in combination with bunds because of the other advantage that it forms bench terrace rapidly.\nPurpose of the Technology: The major purpose is to trap as much rain water as possible and also control soil erosion. Cultivated lands with with Soil bund and Fanya Juu have shown remarkable improvement in soil moistureavailability to crops compared to fields with no measures.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Soil bund and Fanya Juu are established in the same way by digging soil from and embanking it on a contour line. A contour line is laid out by following zero gradient. Once the soil is dug and embanked it is lightly compacted to avoid colapse. To further ensure bund stabilityuseful trees\/shrubs are planted.The planted tree\/shrub species are those offering multiuses such as fodder, fertility improving and fuelwood. Maintenance: It is done by repairing breaks and managing planted trees on the structure or by upgrading the structure by increasing its height and plant improved tree and fruit tree species.\nNatural \/ human environment: The technology is suitable to semiarid climatic condition which have erratic rains and where crop  production is limited by soil moisture stress.

Soil cement water collection pond are ideal to tackle this challenge, as they can capture excess rainfall during monsoon, which is later available during prolonged seasonal water shortage. \nThe Resilient Mountain Village (RMV) project of ICIMOD together with its local partner, CEAPRED tested and demonstrated soil cement ponds with a capacity of 24000 liters. The conservation ponds  were used for irrigating high value off-season horticultural crops (vegetables, fruit, and spices). These crops were irrigated with drip irrigation and micro sprinklers. The ponds were fed from rainwater, upland springs and taps, and household wastewater from kitchen free from soap and detergent. They were established during the dry season during 3 months. They were prepared by selecting a suitable site with a sufficient catchment; mapping out the area and depth of the pond; digging out the soil; removing protruding stones and roots; and compacting and smoothing the sides and bottom of the pond. Then gravel and pebbles were used for the base and the floor and side walls were leveled off. Initial mixture of soil, sand and cement (3:3:1) was applied to roughly plaster all the side walls and gravel was mixed in the mixture while plastering the floor. The following day, the roughly plastered pond was watered and was covered with wet jute sack to keep it moist. This was continued for 3-4 days.  Then again a second mixture of soil, sand and cement (2:2:1) was applied to smoothly plaster the floor and side walls. The pond was watered for the next 3-4 days and was covered with wet jute sacks. Around 4-5 days after the second plaster, the pond was filled with water. For safety, pond was enclosed with a gabion wire\/ bamboo fence (or using any locally available material). The total establishment cost for a soil cement pond with 24000 liters capacity  was USD 311.\nThe main maintenance activity was to maintain the gabion wire\/bamboo fence to prevent livestock and people from entering the pond, and to remove the sediment that accumulates in the pond. The sediment has to be removed once a year carefully by hand and if cracks occur, it should be sealed with a mixture of soil, sand and cement (3:3:1). The total annual maintenance cost for 24000 liters soil cement tank was USD 68.\nThis technology has somehow helped small-land holding farmers to irrigate their rain-fed land during dry months which has increased the crop production and their income as well. \nLand user\u0027s particularly liked that their production increased and that they were able to grow up to three crops per year. Trough this the farmers were able to diversify their crops, and they were less vulnerable to the dry season. In addition, soil cement water ponds are more efficient than plastic-lined conservation ponds which are easily damaged by rats. Although cost effective, the fixed price for this technology is quite high, particularly for smallholder farmers. To lessen this financial burden, local governments can provide subsidies to women and marginalized groups interested in this technology. Self-help groups with a revolving grants system would help expand the use of these ponds and ensure sustained use across Nepal.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1203, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|field management|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 920, 914, 918, 921, 912","readiness_level":"7.

They are normally constructed by cutting and filling to produce a series of level steps or benches. This allows water to infiltrate slowly into the soil. Bench terraces are reinforced by banks of soil or stone that block waterflow above the forward edges. This practice is typical for rice-based cropping systems.It is also helpful to increase the beauty of the land along with increasing the soil stability on these lands.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Md Babul HossainThe Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) are undergoing deforestation and land degradation arising from environmentally unsuitable activities such as tobacco cultivation in sloping land, shifting cultivation and logging. Shifting cultivation, also known as slash-and-burn agriculture. The present shifting cultivation system with short fallow in the Chittagong Hill Tracts has accelerated erosion, land degradation, deforestation, and impoverishment of tribal people in CHT. If the present state of degradation continues, most of the areas under shifting cultivation will be severely degraded and future generations will face more difficulties to eke out their livelihoods on further degraded land. That land shows massive erosion impact as influenced by shifting cultivation (Jhum) at steep and continuously sloping lands.\nTo address the aforesaid constraints in hilly areas of CHT, the Soil Conservation and Watershed Management Centre (SCWMC) of the Soil Resource Development Institute (SRDI) has developed the \u0022Bench Terrace\u0022 technology.  In this technology, some bench like terraces are made on the slopy land of hills where the slope angle is more than 30 degree. The width of the terraces ranges from 2.5 to 3.0 metre. The height of the terraces is 0.6 metre to 1 metre.  An embankment constructed at the outer rim of the terraces prevents run off and soil loss over the outer edge of the terrace during heavy rain in the monsoon. The length of such terraces depends on the topographical contexts within which the terraces are constructed. The technology has various benefits:\n- To reduce the quantum of overland flow\/sheet flow or runoff, and their velocity.\n- To minimize the soil erosion.\n- To conserve soil moisture.\n- To conserve soil fertility and to facilitate farming operations such as ploughing, irrigation etc. on sloping land.\n- To promote intensive land use, permanent agriculture and checking shifting cultivation on steep lands.\n- Bench terraces support proper water management and fertilizers\/manure application. They will also help in increasing cropping intensity within a stable farming system.\nThe hill dwellers, who are the owners of the land, are practicing the technology because it has established a permanent solution for crop production instead shifting cultivation. The technology contributes to a reduction in land slides, soil erosion and to increased farm income. Bench Terraces are widely being used in the hilly areas of India, Nepal, Srilanka, Tamilnadu etc.  \n.COMMENTS:This area is not under reserve forest area of Bangladesh forest department, instead it includes shifting cultivation areas of hill dwellers.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|water use optimization for sustainability|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|forestry management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 921, 918, 919, 922, 920, 917, 927","readiness_level":"9.

Land users in affected areas are trained on the principle behind the diseases and means and ways to overcome it. Banana plants in seriously affected farms are uprooted and destroyed and non disease host crops usually maize and common beans are grown for starvation and destruction of BXW pathogen. The land is not used for banana production for a period of 6 months and instead substitute crops ensures food and income security to land users. Leguminous cover crops (beans) and crop residual management skills applied on the farm revitalize the soil health in terms of biomass, moisture and nutrient recycling. After 6 months, banana production is resumed where production is based on recommended husbandry practices combined with SLM conservation measures. The use of certified banana cultivars, optimal plant geometry and disease control cultural practices are some of the basic recommendation. Certified banana cultivars are planted at a space of 3m x 3m. The size of a hole used to plant banana is 0.9x0.9 m wide and 0.6 deep. During digging top soil is separated from subsoil. 2 -3 tins of manure are mixed with the top soil and the mixture is put in the bottom of the hole. The holes are left for microbial decay to take place and banana planting is done after 1 or 2 months. The tied Fanya chini water retention ditches are water harvesting and conserving structures constructed by digging trenches along the contour where dug soil is thrown to the lower side to form an embankment that prevents soil from falling back in. A-FRAME method is used to mark a contour line and on the other hand ARM OUTSTRETCHED LEVEL method determines how far apart the Fanya chini retention ditch should be. Unlike other retention ditches, the dug ditches are not continuous but instead are tied at regular interval with small cross\u2013ties of 0.4-0.6m length. Ties intercept the ditch at right angle to form a series of narrow rectangular segments of infiltration ditches each of 5 meters long, 0.6m wide and 0.6m deep arranged in series within a contour line. Ties helps to prevent irregular flow of runoff and to ensure an evenly distribution of captured water. Fanya chini embankments are stabilized by planting crops on them the common crops are pigeon pea (space used between plant is stand is 1m x 1m), lemon grass (30cm x 30cm) or pineapples (60cm x 60cm). Mulching is done using grasses. The dominant grass species used is Hyperrenia rufa where a mulching depth of 15 cm is used.\nPurpose of the Technology: PURPOSE: Improved food and fodder productivity, soil moisture and water holding capacity, nutrient recycling, and organic matter content, biomass cycle, crop tolerance to drought, income and food security, poverty reduction and health. Prevent unproductive evaporation of green water, combating soil erosion by water runoff and biological degradation due the deadly BXW disease.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: ESTABLISHMENT: procurement and mobilization of working tools, uprooting and destruction of infected plants in affected fields, land tilling and harrowing, planting of alternative crops or creation of a productive disease free buffer zone,  temporal harvesting of maize and beans, land preparation\/ demarcation and spacing of holes for resumed banana planting, digging holes, manure application before planting, banana planting, demarcation of contour line for construction of Fanyachini contours with ties, digging and construction of Fanya chini contours with ties, vegetative stabilization of Fanya chini bunds (using lemon grass, pineapples or pigeon pea), random planting of castor oil plants for future anchoring support of plants with heavy bunches and mulching application. MAINTENANCE: hand weeding to control noxious weeds combined with other pest and disease control (control of nematodes and weevils), de-suckering to leave the mother plant and two baby plants, de-trashing or trimming of unproductive leaves, regular removal\/de-bud of inflorescence (male bud) using a forked wooden pole once the bunch is completed to prevent BXW transition through insect vector , recurrent manure application, removal of sediments and maintenance of Fanyachini bunds, harvest of bananas, maize, pineapples and pigeon pea. INPUTS USED: largely includes labour (strenuously varying from light, medium and heavy), tools (hand hoe, forked hole, machetes, sickles, spade, mattock and A-frame), seedlings; improved or certified banana varieties, pineapples suckers, lemon grass and castor oil, seeds (beans, maize and pigeon pea), farm yard manure and mulching materials (preferably Hyperennial spps).\nNatural \/ human environment: NATURAL ENV: The land use type is cropland with annual, perennial and some fruit tree crops. The technology involves a combination of agronomic, vegetative, structural and management conservation measures. Management measure involves all activities related to temporal shift to alternative crops for making the farm disease hot free and for staving and destroying the disease pathogen.

The dominant crop in the technology area is banana. In this technology banana is widely spacing to 4m x 4m for the purpose of providing enough space for annual or recurrent soil nutrient feeding using compost ditches or baskets. Compost basket pits of 0.6 m depth and 3x3m width are dug between 4 banana plants. Baskets pits are dug recurrently and filled with farm manure, compost (crop residuals), leguminous green manure (tithonia) and ash and later covered with soil to activate nutrient release though microbial disintegration and avoid volatilization of greenhouse gas through direct sunlight. The size of a hole dug for the purpose of planting banana is 0.6 m depth and 0.6 m height. During digging top soil is separated from subsoil. In initial manure application, 2 tin of manure are mixed with the top soil and the mixture is put in the bottom of the hole. The center of the hole is marked with a stick and waiting is done for 1 or 2 before planting. During planting of banana, only two third 0.24m cubic of the hole is filling with soil and one third 0.12m cubic of the hole is left to form a water retention\/harvest pit. Tithonia diversifolia (leguminous shrubs) are planted within the Kibanja farm purposefully for improving soil nutrient recycling though nitrogen fixing and at the same time is incorporate in compost to improve its quality. Infiltration ditches of 0.6 m depth and 0.6 m width and varying lengths are constructed for the purpose of impeding, trapping and harvesting water runoff. Fruit trees are planted in sub soil zone within the water infiltration ditches. The aim is to control nutrient competition between trees and annual\/ biennial in the top soil or annual root zone and at the same time fruit tree roots in the subsoil zone is used as nutrient pump i.e. return nutrient lost through leaching to the top soil in form of mulching and litter. Improved banana varieties (FIAH 23) and certified endogenous germ plasma, de-trashing and de-suckering to maintain optimal plant geometry is part and per se of recommended husbandry practice\nPurpose of the Technology: Improved food productivity, improved soil moisture content and water holding capacity. Improve nutrient recycling, organic matter content and biomass cycle. Prevent unproductive evaporation of green water and improving soil micro-climate. Combating land degradation through soil erosion caused by water runoff, chemical degradation due to nutrient leaching, biological degradation due the deadly BXW and other diseases and water degradation due to unproductive evaporation of the green water. And also plays significant role in adaptation and mitigation to drought climate. Improved economic returns accrued from surplus food production. Improve year round accessibility of food, shock resistance availability of food and varied food utilization and hence poverty reduction and improved health.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Establishment activities: land tilling, harrowing, demarcation and spacing of holes for planting banana, digging holes, manure application before banana planting, planting bananas, to demarcate, level and space Fanya chini\/infiltration ditches\/trenches using A-frame and arm outstretched level, ditch\/trench digging, vegetative stabilization of Fanya chini\/infiltration ditches, planting of fruit trees within ditches.

Pigeon pea can be grown on depleted or infertile soils, both on gently sloping plots and in non-flooded lowlands. Sowing takes place at the onset of the rainy season. If the farmer\u0027s priority is to restore soil fertility, the recommended plant spacing is 50 cm within and between rows, with two seeds per seed hole, totalling 20 kg of seed per hectare. If the adopter wishes to harvest the maximum number of seeds for consumption, it is recommended to increase the spacing between rows to 1m, resulting in a seed quantity of 10 kg\/ha. In both cases, it is advisable to sow the plants in staggered rows and conduct weeding around the seedlings at the initial stages of cultivation.\nAt the start of the second rainy season, the plants are pruned to a height of 40 cm, and the prunings are spread on the ground or partly used for animal feed. The wood collected can also be used as firewood. If the biomass is well developed, every other row can be cut to increase seed production. From the third year onwards, it is generally possible to thin the mini-forest further and reintroduce low-demand crops such as cassava.\nOne of the advantages of this technology is the restoration of soil fertility. Being a legume, pigeon pea fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere. Furthermore, through the extensive burrowing of taproots, essential mineral elements are retrieved from deep within the soil and brought back to the surface in the form of abundant litter. This process promotes the revival of biological activity in the soil. Pigeon pea cover also curbs surface erosion. With this technology, it is possible to produce edible seeds, animal fodder and firewood.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1197, 1200, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|animal production|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Farm management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|field management","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 899, 918, 917, 922, 910, 912, 914","readiness_level":"7.

However, climate change is exacerbating production challenges, with higher temperatures, heatwaves, water scarcity, harsh winds, leading to poor pollination, and increased pests amongst other issues. Small-scale date palm producers in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries face additional problems of managing unsold or excess produce. Short harvesting periods and high deterioration rates of some date varieties make the situation worse. A common solution to extend shelf life is freezing. However, this has several drawbacks including storage and handling difficulties, nutrient and flavour degradation, and high energy costs.\nTo tackle these post-harvest challenges, the International Center of Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) developed an innovative Solar Mobile Dryer (SMB) for drying dates, achieving the desired colour for marketing while shielding the produce from dust and rain. The mobile solar dryer includes tables with polycarbonate covers forming a tunnel. Each table is 3 meters long, 1 meter wide, with walls 15-30 cm high, and raised 40 cm off the ground on metal legs. Dates are placed on a mesh for enhanced air flow and drying. Temperatures are kept at 70 degrees Celsius, the same as industrial date drying, to avoid textural changes, hardness, and colour alteration. Two versions of the tables have been produced.\nThe Jordan version, uses an iron frame and includes four tables that can form a 12-meter tunnel. This dryer has a 12V 40W DC fan, with a control unit and solar panel system, providing 6 hours of operation during the day and 2 hours at night, controlled by a temperature sensor.\nThe second version was developed in United Arab Emirates (UAE) and features a lighter aluminium frame and a 12V 80W fan fixed on one table. It includes temperature and humidity sensors, two solar panels, and a 20A charging controller.\nThe advantage and disadvantages of the SMB are as follows:\nAdvantages:\n+ Improves fruit quality, especially in humid areas. Produce dried in greenhouses are often higher quality than those sun-dried.\n+ Prevents contamination by insects, birds, dust, and rain.\n+ Saves energy and drying time, improves product quality, and increases process efficiency.\n+ Solar drying systems have low operation and maintenance costs.\n+ Reduces waste and loss rates.\n+ Reduces air pollution and greenhouse gases from fossil fuels.\n+ Can be used for other products (e.g., fruits, vegetables, medicinal, and aromatic plants).\nDisadvantages:\n- Drying is limited to sunny days unless integrated with conventional energy systems. Drying without sunshine depends on the humidity difference between inside and outside the chamber.\n- Solar drying is slower than conventional fuel or electricity-based dryers.\n- Requires large land areas and long drying times, subject to solar radiation and temperature fluctuations.\n- Farmers may lack maintenance knowledge for the system.\nEconomic evaluations of the SMD for two date varieties, Majhool and Lulu, demonstrate high profitability. The initial investment in the SMD is approximately 1,000 USD, with an estimated lifetime of about 10 years. The drying process takes between 1 and 3 days. The SMD has a capacity to dry between 6 and 12 kilograms of dates per square meter of drying surface in the SMD, resulting in production of around 5-10 kilograms of dried dates. Maintenance costs are estimated at 25% of the initial investment, while variable costs such as labour, packaging, and transportation are around 500 USD per month. Based on these figures, the net income per kilogram of dried dates is approximately 2.7 USD. Depending on the date variety, the return-on-investment ranges between 240% and 310%, with a payback period of about 4 months. These numbers indicate that the innovation is highly profitable for farmers.\nThe SMD is a crucial ICARDA initiative for smallholder date palm growers in the GCC countries, offering energy savings, waste reduction, and post-harvest loss prevention, enhancing the competitiveness of modern agriculture in high date production areas.\nWe express our sincere gratitude to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Secretariat for funding this research under the \u0022Development of sustainable date palm production systems in the GCC countries of the Arabian Peninsula\u0022 project.

Agriculture is the major source of their livelihoods and it purely dependents on glacier meltwater which makes the community more susceptible due to the unstable behaviour of the glaciers. Irrigation is practised with traditional irrigation canals, intake of which is located at glacier terminus. On one hand lowering of glacier surface disconnects many irrigation canals. Uncertain glacier behaviour has resulted in the decline of water availability and even forced some communities to abandon their agricultural land. On the other hand, only 2% of land in Gilgit-Baltistan is used for agriculture purposes whereas a huge chunk of barren land lays above the Hunza River, which cannot be cultivated through the traditional irrigation system hence it remains unutilized. \nTo address both issues, ICIMOD together with a local level partner\u2019s consortia piloted solar water lifting to irrigate barren land for establishing apple orchards along Hunza River at Passu and Morkhun Villages. These two villages are located far from each other. In each village, orchards of 2.5 hectare area were established and the drip irrigation system installed was efficiently used to irrigate apple plants. Similar technological packages (solar pump, drip irrigation and mulch) were applied in both the villages.\nThe pumping system comprises a submersible pump (Lorentz, Germany 1 HP) powered by 500 watts solar panels to carry the water to storage tanks (500 litres)  made up of plastic that has been placed  upslope at 100 feet vertical height from the river. The water from the storage tanks was routed\/led to the apple saplings through the surface and pressure compensating  drip irrigation system. The pumping capacity of the pump is 7.5 litres\/minute, which is irrigating around 3300 apple plants at Passu and Morkhun. The storage tank was kept 60 feet vertical height from the orchard field to be irrigated. Tree to tree distance and row to row distance of apple was maintained at 15 feet in Passu and 10 feet in Morkhun. Drip irrigation  (surface and pressure compensating) system was established to irrigate each apple plant, the emitter of the drip system was adjusted according to the plant to plant distance of apple seedlings to be irrigated.  Pits were constructed for planting apples  and later they also served as water harvesting pits \/check basins.  Plastic mulch was applied to each apple plants covering a radius around the trunk to minimize soil moisture losses, reduce weed and reduce soil erosion by water and wind. \nThe cost of an integrated package including solar pumps with accessories, storage tanks, intake and distribution systems (i.e. from river to tank and tank to trees), drip irrigation, apple plants and operational expenses (manpower) for both the sites was US$ 42000 for 5 ha of land. Village Development Organizations (VDO) of both villages take care of maintenance of technological package through a maintenance fund, which is being raised by participating households (HHs). Benefit sharing mechanism has been agreed among the participating HHs. The total income would be divided equally among participating 72 HHs in Morkhun and 135 HHs in Passu.\nThe technological package was applied in arid climate at an elevation ranging from 2340m to 4877 m above sea level. Passu is located at 36.49o latitude and 74.90o longitude and Morkhun is located at 36.6o N latitudes and 74.86o E longitudes. The area receives 150-200 mm annual rain-fall. The temperature ranges from 11 degree Celsius to 29 degree Celsius. The population of Passu and Morkhun is 1168 and 653 persons respectively. Both villages are semi nomadic and depend mainly on livestock rearing.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation|Solar-powered farming systems|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1188, 1044, 1045, 1015","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|field management|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 918, 920, 914, 909","readiness_level":"7.

Ridges are about 60 to 90 cm high, which means crops are kept above the water, even during the wet season. The ditches between the ridges hold water for six to eight months per year and can be used to keep fish as well as being a source of water to irrigate the crops.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Wolfgang DuifhuizenThe Sorjan is a system that serves as an alternate of deep drains (ditches) and raised beds for crop cultivation and fish rearing. In coastal Bangladesh the ridges are mostly around one meter wide at the top and spaced two meters apart \u2013 although in places ridges and spacing can be wider than this. The Sorjan system is applied in lowland areas which suffer from water logging and salinization. The widely spread technology is also practiced in Char Nangulia, Noakhali district in the Meghna estuary in Bangladesh. The main economic activities in this area are small-scale agriculture, livestock keeping, fish rearing and informal business. Before introduction of the Sorjan system (by the Bangladesh by Department of Agriculture Extension) only deep-water tolerant traditional low-yielding paddy could be cultivated during the rainy season and in the dry season, the capillary rise of salty ground water led to poor yields for most crops, if they survived at all.\nThe beds are about 60 to 90 cm high, which means crops are kept above the water, even during the wet season. The ditches between the ridges hold water for six to eight months per year and can be used to rear fish and ducks as well as being a source of water to irrigate the crops. In most cases nets are spanned over the ditches, allow climbing plants to grow over them utilizing the space in an efficient way. The sorjan system is is applied in low land areas and frequently suffer from water logging and sometimes salt water intrusion. This system with raised bed enables the cultivation of vegetables in these locations.\nThe main function of Sorjan is to grow crops on raised beds so that roots are protected against stagnant water. As the area is partially excavated, the deeper areas can be used for fish rearing whenever inundated and crops such as cucumber and gourds can grow vines on supporting nets spanned over the ditches to maximize productivity of limited space available. In the Philipines Sorjan system, it has also been reported that rice is cultivated in the ditches with shallow water and at the same time, other crops on the beds.\nTo install Sorjan a farmer needs to make raised beds for planting the crops and rear fish in the deep drains. This is usually done by hand with help of local laborers, in some cases an excavator is rented to do the job. To support the crop to be planted , a framework of bamboo, string and netting is built over the ditches to support a sequence of climbing plants.\nMaintenance of the beds is done regularly whenever necessary and the crop netting is replaced every 3 years. In the area farmers predominantly use urea and other chemical fertilizers to lesser extent, few farmers use animal manure and compost. Most Sorjan ridges have a permanent undergrowth of grass to keep the slopes stable. In some cases, during dry season, goats graze the grass in the ditches and slopes.\nBefore the rains start in March, cucumbers are planted, and these are followed by a variety of gourds (including snake, bottle, bitter and ribbed gourds) in the early monsoon, with yard long bean (asparagus bean) and country bean (lablab bean) in the later monsoon, with country beans continuing to be harvested through the dry season up to the following March. During dry season the beans are sometimes intercropped with chillies, tomatoes and amaranth. These crops overlap with each other, with relay cropping allowing continuous harvesting for 9 or 10 months per year (early June to March).\nThe significant increase of income a small-holder farmer can make in the area alongside having fresh fish and vegetable for the greater part of the year have been reasons for farmers taking up Sorjan. The Sorjan system is propagated as a measure to mitigate effects of increased salinity and\/or water logging due to sea-level rise. Sorjan does not facilitate any mechanization as the narrow beds and ditch bottoms are only accessible by foot.COMMENTS:Also applied elsewhere in Bangladesh, the Philipines and Indonesia.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1204, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|fisheries products management|Farm management|field management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|animal production|Alternative food production|production of food in limited spaces (e.g. vertical farming)","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 900, 910, 914, 1180, 916, 918, 919, 920, 921, 915, 899, 934, 935","readiness_level":"7.

Floodwater is distributed from field to field: when a field is completely flooded (to a depth of about 0.5 m), water is conveyed to the immediate downstream field by breaching one of the bunds. This process continues until all the water is used up.  Arable fields need to be flooded several times. The water soaks deep into the soil profile (up to 2.4 m) and provides moisture sufficient for two or even three harvests: crop growth is entirely dependent on the residual soil moisture. The main crop grown is sorghum; maize is the next most important. Sedimentation is as important as water management: With each flood, soil is built up by depositing rich sediment on the fields. Due to the force of the floods, the diversion structures are frequently damaged and\/or washed away. Reconstruction and maintenance are labour-intensive and require collective community action.\nNatural \/ human environment: Elaborate local regulations, organization and cooperation at the community level are prerequisites for successful management of spate irrigation systems.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 160 km2.\nCurrent spate irrigation area in Eritrea is 16\u2019000 hectares.

The increased vegetation cover reduces runoff and soil loss.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Dirk PretoriusDue to severe land degradation over many decades of goat farming, the restoration of the so-called \u2018thicket biome\u2019 is taking place on a large scale in the Baviaanskloof Nature Reserve and Camdeboo National Park in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. The restoration projects have been introduced in parts of the thicket biome that receive 350 to 500 mm annual average rainfall. The main direct cause of degradation is overgrazing\/browsing by goats (Boer and Angora) over the past 100 years. The overutilization of vegetation occurs mainly on valley bottoms and footslopes in mountainous areas where relatively fertile soils occur. This has resulted in large expanses of open vegetation canopy under which a high degree of runoff occurs - and subsequent soil loss leading to increased sediment loads in downstream drainage systems. The thicket biome vegetation (especially spekboom) is well known for its ability to sequester large amounts of carbon and therefore help towards mitigating climate change. The improved vegetation cover also contributes towards an increase in biodiversity, and therefore has a positive impact on tourism also. Establishment of spekboom in riplines can be used in combination with other technologies e.g. brush packing (laying cut bush on the soil surface), silt fences (low barriers across the slope) or fibre rolls. This technology can be employed in any similar semi-arid environment to restore degraded catchments - using locally appropriate plant species.\nAfter identification of sites to be rehabilitated, this is followed by the identification of suitable sources of plant material for transplantation at the rehabilitation areas. In the case of the project in the Eastern Cape, spekboom cuttings of 30 to 50 cm in length were taken from existing stands, then left for one to two weeks in the sun to dry slightly before being transplanted in the rehabilitation sites. Care must be taken not to over-harvest healthy spekboom stands - not more than 30% should be removed.\nRiplines need to be created along the contour by means of mechanisation or manual labour. Riplines should be between 3 and 10 meter apart - depending on the slope (closer on steep slopes) - 10 to 20 cm deep and just wide enough to plant the spekboom cuttings to a depth of at least 10 cm. Cuttings are planted between 15 to 20 cm apart within the ripline, so as to form a continuous barrier\/sediment trap along the contour. The ripline promotes water infiltration into the rootzone of the cuttings. Cuttings need to be firmed-in with soil dug from the ripline. Watering the spekboom after planting is recommended \u2013 if possible. Brush packing (brush packing with thorny biomass to prevent grazing and provide a micro-climate for grass seed to germinate and establish) between riplines with local woody material (if available locally, and preferably thorny branches) is recommended to provide protection against grazing and to create a micro-climate for vegetation growth. In between riplines, silt fences or fibre rolls can be used to slow water runoff and to trap sediment. Maintenance includes the replanting of cuttings where mortality occurred.COMMENTS:Only implemented on degraded Thicket Biome areas on low to moderate slopes.Main animal species and products: Various game species.\nNumber of growing seasons per year: 1\nLivestock density: Only wildlife - low densitySOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Native species utilization|Traditional and indigenous practices|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1201, 1206, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|disaster management","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 919, 921, 922, 920, 910, 1154","readiness_level":"7.

As the wheel turns, the scoop will alternatively introduce either water or air into the spiral tube. The pressure from the hydrostatic head generated from the column of water introduced by the scoop, is added to the pressure from previous scoops, and so as the wheel turns it will increase the water pressure with every turn of the spiral. The main characteristic of the spiral water pump is that it can pump water without the input of electricity or fuel. It works with the power of the water flow. Once built, the spiral water pump is able to push water up to 30 metres high (horizontal push) and up to 70 metres away (vertical push). The water push (how far water will be pushed horizontally and vertically) depends on how big the wheel of the Spiral Water Pump is built, and how much tube is put around the wheel.\nPurpose of the Technology: The spiral tube water pumps were installed with the aim to provide irrigation water from rivers to higher level crop fields. Land users in GBAO are dependent on irrigation water to grow their crops and without the use of water pumps they can not access the water from rivers that are at a lower level than the fields.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The type, size and thus material costs of a spiral water pump will depend on 2 parameters: first, the irrigation needs (how far the water needs to go and how much is used per day) and second, the available water flow (the velocity and depth of the water source). There is only an initial investment in material for the water wheel, after that the pump should work without any further costs incurred.\nNatural \/ human environment: The spiral water pumps were installed in 4 different districts of the semi-arid to arid GBAO region where the availability of irrigation water is crucial to crop production. So far, 4 spiral water pumps have been installed for test runs but it is very likely that they will be adopted by other farmers as they observe the benefits created by the ones that are already in place.COMMENTS:1 spiral water pump was installed in each of these 4 districtsMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): There has been less snow cover during winter time, and less precipitation in the spring, resulting in a lack of irrigation water, and a decline of soil fertility.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 920, 910, 914, 918","readiness_level":"7.

The consequent grazing pressure maintains the grassland in an immature, high-quality state, while resting the other half, allowing optimal recovery from the previous full years grazing. The technology is simple, requiring less fencing than more complex systems, without compromising sustainability or ecological function. These concepts can also be used for management in pastoral-wildlife systems to create habitat heterogeneity (short and tall grassland).\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Richard FynnThe Split Ranch Grazing Strategy (SRG) was developed by Riaan Dames in the North West province, South Africa. It is fundamentally different to popular rotational management systems and contains several conceptual advances. One key difference is that SRG provides a full-year uninterrupted recovery period for rangeland after grazing. This enables grasses to maximize nutrient recovery over the main pulses of nutrient mineralization in the early wet season, and to maximize root growth and associated nutrient storage over the late wet season and early dry season - when most root growth occurs. Optimal recovery periods should ideally, therefore, encompass the full wet season and the early dry season. This contrasts with rotational grazing where recovery and grazing periods are apportioned across these two periods, with resting periods often not occurring in key periods of nutrient uptake and root growth.\nA major problem with having both grazing and recovery periods in the same season is that grassland is able to mature during recovery periods, greatly reducing forage quality and grass growth rates, thereby negatively impacting animal production. Another problem is that complex rotational grazing requires strategies investing much in a complex and expensive fencing infrastructure. The solution is a fundamentally different strategy where some paddocks are grazed the whole year to prevent grassland maturation and other paddocks are simultaneously rested to optimize recovery. In addition, paddocks should be as few, and as large as possible, to maximize livestock access to functional resource heterogeneity, thereby improving adaptive foraging options, while reducing costs of fencing (fencing can even be replaced by using physical boundaries (e.g. roads, rivers, etc.) and herding the livestock.\nLivestock are maintained in the grazing paddocks until mid-dry season to ensure that grasses in the rested paddocks have completed root growth and ceased all other growth \u2013 thus fully rested and recovered. A full years rest allows maximum uptake and storage of nutrients in deep, strong root systems and crowns. Thus when these grasses are grazed in the next season they have not only efficient root uptake of moisture and nutrients from the soil but also can re-allocate nutrients stored in roots to leaf production after each grazing event, resulting in a productive supply of high-quality fresh leaf to livestock over the growing season.\nMovement of livestock into the year-long rested paddocks halfway through the dry season ensures that they have a large reserve of forage. Concentration of livestock on half the available area (half the paddocks are rested and the other half grazed) ensures sufficient grazing pressure to maintain grassland in an immature, high-quality and rapidly-growing state for maximizing forage quality, leaf production and livestock production, further enhanced by greater adaptive foraging options in large paddocks. The technology was started in North West province South Africa, and is now being taken up in Botswana and Namibia. A model example is Tiisa Kalahari Ranch in the Ghanzi region of Botswana. The ranch has been partitioned into several four-paddock cells, each with their own cattle herd. Cattle graze two paddocks while the other two are rested for a full year. Cattle enter the rested paddocks, which have developed a large reserve of forage, in the mid dry season (July) once forage is depleted in the two grazed paddocks. This technology (SRG), used on the award-winning Danielskuil ranch in South Africa, has been employed at Tiisa for six years after being in a degraded state. Indications are that the rangeland has been steadily recovering with increases in abundance of high-quality grasses. Monitoring programs are being established to monitor the trends in cover of the various grass species over time.COMMENTS:Longitude: -21.60026 (decimal degrees)\nLatitude: 21.48969\nNot restricted to any size of land - any size ranchThe technology can be used for ranching cattle, sheep or goats or using planned herding of these livestock types according to the key concepts outlined in the technology.

In summer and autumn livestock is grazed on intensive and far away pastures.\nOne of the disadvantages of the close to village pastures is the lack of water for livestock consumption. Daily at noon, shepherds bring their livestock to the Sokuluk river to water it. As a result livestock has to range between village, pasture and river four times per day, which led to the creation of numerous trails on the pastures contributing to soil erosion. Pasture erosion is obviously visible near the river and around the village.\nAt the same time, there was a spring in one of the canyons clogged up with stones and  mud. As the stream of water was not sufficient to quench livestock\u0027s thirst, the herders used to direct it straight to the river.\nAytkulov Duyshon, a resident of Saz village, cleaned this spring and built a watering point for animals with support of the CAMP \u0022Alatoo\u0022 and the local administration. First, the exact effluence of the spring was determined and cleaned from mud. Then, 15 meters below this spot three interlinked troughs were constructed. These throughs were 1,8 m long, 0,5 m wide and 0,5 m deep. Each following trough was located below the previous one and water could flow through in form of a cascade. Below these troughs a pool (2 m diameter) was built. The edges of the troughs were set 0,2 m above the soil to prevent clogging up of water with stones and soil. At the end of the construction the troughs were connected with pipes to the place the water was coming out. This place was edged with stones and a tube was placed into a small 0,30 m trench. At this water point, 15-17 animals (depending on their size) can drink water simultaneously. As a result of this work livestock had to  move twice per day - in the morning and in the evening. On the eroded pathways non palatable plants began to grow.\nThe purpose of this technology is the provision of safe drinking water for livestock and to prevent pasture erosion.\nRealization of the technology became possible after the workshop on \u0022Sustainable use of natural resources through soil and water conservation technologies\u0022 organized by CAMP \u0022Alatoo\u0022. During this workshop villagers developed a project using the CAMP \u0022Alatoo\u0022\u0027s collection of technologies on soil and water conservation. Aytkulov Duyshon (the leader) and his team developed a project on cleaning the spring and creating a water point. The group contributed to the introduction of the technology and CAMP \u0022Alatoo\u0022 financed part of the cost.\nThe spring is located at 1,600 m asl. in the Sary Koo canyon. The area is covered with different types of grass and with a shrubby vegetation (spirea, barberry, hawthorn and wold rose) on the north slope. Eroded pathways are visible on the slopes and at the bottom of the canyon a gully is developing. People use the three types of pastures (close to village, intensive and far away pastures) under \u0022the pasture law of KR\u0022. A pasture committee has not yet been established. The village does not practice pasture rotation and a pasture use plan does not exist.

These were widened with the occasional construction of check dams to prevent rill erosion from the newly revived spring waters.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Karma WangdiTrenches and check dams play a vital role in the implementation of the springshed revival technology in the picturesque hilly village of Lholing. This innovative approach to rejuvenating springsheds has extended its reach from the lush pasturelands above the village all the way down to the very first household of Lholing, resulting in the construction of approximately 20 ponds of varying sizes, replenished by springsheds. In some instances, the creation and expansion of these springsheds required the utilisation of mechanical excavators, emphasising the magnitude of the project.\nThe revitalised springsheds now produce an array of springs, each contributing water that eventually converges into a common tributary meandering towards the village. This valuable water is collected and stored in purposefully constructed water harvesting ponds, serving as a reliable source for kitchen garden irrigation and cattle feeding. While the primary objective was to address the pressing issue of drinking water scarcity in the community, it also yielded secondary benefits. These encompassed the provision of a drinking water source for the wildlife inhabiting the area, as well as supporting the irrigation needs of the kitchen garden. The implementation of check dams yielded additional advantages by mitigating rill and gully erosion and serving as effective filters for muddy spring water. This sustainable land management strategy was accomplished through a series of distinct activities. Firstly, an exhaustive survey and assessment of the springshed area was conducted to identify suitable locations for trenches and check dams. This process took into account factors such as the topography of the terrain, the hydrological dynamics, and the composition of the soil. Subsequently, a comprehensive plan and design was developed for the trenches and check dams, including their dimensions, spacing, and alignment. The involvement of experts and stakeholders during this stage ensured that the chosen design was optimal in terms of its effectiveness (Sameul, 2008).\nThe execution phase involved the excavation and shaping of the trenches according to the design, followed by the construction of check dams. Trenching are required in open areas (where there is no vegetation cover) to trap surface runoff and enhance infiltration. Trenches can be dug along contour lines in a staggered or continuous pattern. However, the size of the trench is determined based on the site conditions. The number of trenches\/pits depends on size, annual precipitation and the slope gradient of the recharge area in smaller area. Wedge shaped trenches are recommended for open areas while staggered or continuous trenches are recommended on slopy areas. Trenches are recommended in larger open area, while pits these check dams were specifically devised to retain water and control its flow. As part of gully treatment and to increase water infiltration, check dams are constructed. Typically, walls or barriers were built using locally available materials such as stone, wood, or concrete. \nThe advantages and benefits derived from this technology are manifold. In addition to the aforementioned advantages associated with springsheds, the implementation of trenches and check dams significantly contributed to the preservation and conservation of the fertile topsoil, preventing its degradation and erosion. The land users in the village expressed contentment with the successful revival of the springsheds, recognising their multifaceted contributions. Furthermore, they were duly impressed by the check dams\u0027 efficacy in preventing soil erosion and their ability to filter muddy water, ensuring a reliable and clean water supply (RSPN, 2023).\nThe creation of the ponds was especially appreciated as they served as a convenient water source for grazing cattle in the nearby jungle. However, despite the numerous benefits, there was a sense of dissatisfaction among many villagers due to the increasing number of wild animals, including wild boar and deer that frequented the ponds to quench their thirst. This unexpected influx of wildlife posed a significant threat to farms located in close proximity to the open springsheds.COMMENTS:The technology does not interfere with any protected areas.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Farm management|disaster management|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|field management","use_cases_id":"916, 920, 921, 917, 897, 899, 1186, 910, 1154, 922, 918, 914","readiness_level":"7.

In sandy soils the dikes around the irrigation channels and fields cannot hold the water due to erosion. Old rice bags are filled with sand and piled up to form stable dikes on the short term, and Pandanus suckers are planted every 0.5 \u2013 1 m to ensure a stability on the long term due to the root system.\nThe purpose of the dikes, stabilized for short and long term, is to ensure the flow of water to the paddy fields by reducing the riverbank erosion. It also helps to keep the water in the paddy fields. The Pandanus can be used to make mats and baskets, although this use diminishes due to the low cost of plastic. After a few years, the Pandanus on the dike is tall and spiky enough to fence off cattle and protect the rice from grazing.\nTo stabilize 50 m of dike, around 100 old rice bags are filled with sand and piled up on a height of 2 bags. Pandanus suckers are planted on the water side, between the bags, and sand is used to cover the plants and bags. Poles and sticks are used to stabilize the bags and plants until the root system is established. This is done in the beginning of the rainy season to ensure the growth of the sucker. In the first year, after each rain the eroded sand has to be added back to the dike. After the establishment phase, from the second year on, the Pandanus have to be cut back as they grow quickly and can grow tall.\nThe analysed area is flat (slope \u003C 2%), with a tropical climate (dry season from November to May and wet season from June to October), and the soils are mostly sandy or loamy. The soil has a low fertility, contains little organic matter, and acidifies. The area has been deforested a long time ago, and the groundwater table is rather high (1-2 m during the dry season, on the surface during wet season).\nDue to climate change, farmers notice more erratic rainfall, temperature rises and more recurrent droughts. Rice is the predominant crop grown in the area, since it serves as staple food (mix subsistence and commercial activities). Cattle are usually grazing on the fields after the harvest, without much control. Thus the cattle grazes too often and too much on the same spot, leading to degradation.\nThe increasing migration rate (the young generation leaves the villages to work in the cities, garment industry or abroad) results in a decrease of available labour force in the area which has detrimental effects on the agricultural activities. Furthermore, the civil war in the 1970s (Khmer Rouge) led to the loss of agricultural knowledge.

Families are forced to spend up to 25% of the family savings for the construction of new houses.\nThis problem was solved using the technology of sand dune stabilization which includes the installation of mechanical sand dune fixation devices (MSDFs) and planting vegetation adapted to desert environments. MSDFs were made using bundles of reed (of 1-1.2m length), which widely grows along the channel banks. The bundles, 0.02-0.03m in diameter, were bent in the middle (0.5m) and placed vertically into the sand in 25-30cm depth. In this way they are used to establish quadratic parcels with typically 25cm high sidewalls. The optimum grid size is 2x2m and depends on local wind and sand transport conditions. 2x2m MSDFs are used when winds of different directions dominate, otherwise MSDFs are set formed by rows perpendicular to the predominant sand transport direction\nThe MSDFs assure sand dune stabilization for 2 years. In subsequent years, the stabilization of the sandy surface is achieved by planting seedlings of local desert trees and shrubs and their natural reproduction. 3500-4000 seedlings per ha should be planted if the dunes are to be successfully stabilized without irrigation. If the plants are watered three times in the first season, then the standard for seedling planting is 1200-1300 plants per ha. The planting scheme is as follows: the distance between the plants in the row is 2m, and the spacing between the rows is 4m. Plants are planted 20-40cm deep after the sand has been soaked by rainfall in January-February once temperatures are above 0 \u00baC\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of this technology is to improve environmental conditions and the sustainability of farms in the village in general.

The staggered Contour Trenches (SCTs) were constructed at a degraded site in Bamyan center (Bamyan province) by Agha Khan Foundation (AKF) project with financial support of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).\nTotally 1470 contour trenches were constructed at the site, which has an area of 24 hectares.\nThe size of each trench measured 10 m in length, 0.6 m in width and 0.5 m in depth. The trenches had soil bunds on the lower side having a width of 1 m and height of 0.3 m. Contour lines were prepared using an A-frame and lime and the spacing between two contour lines was 8 m considering the slope. All the trenches were dug out manually. Local people were employed for construction works.  Along with the SCTs, other measures were applied such as plantation of fodder grass, shrub and non-fruit trees, gully plugs, water harvesting tanks and brushwood plugs. The area is excluded from grazing and shrub cutting. \nThe land was extensive grazing land before the project implementation and got extremely degraded due to a lack of management by the land users. There was rampant exploitation of natural vegetation for meeting domestic energy needs and for grazing. Droughts, which frequently occur in the region, contributed to the slow degradation of the vegetation.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of the technology is to reduce flash flood risks and improve land productivity (both upstream and downstream) so that more fodder, fuel wood and fruits could be produced and farmers affected by flash floods could grow more crops. The technology, which is part of a watershed technology system, helps in retaining runoff and sediment and improves soil moisture content. It also helps in water infiltration which eventually contributes to improved ground water recharge.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: SCTs were established in a step-wise manner; as follows: (1) Site surveying, (2) Site mapping, (3) Planning, (4) Marking contour lines with the help of an A-frame, and (5) Trench excavation and bund construction. \nThe establishment cost for staggered contour trenches, was about 15,500 USD or 645 USD\/ha. Most of the money was spent on labour. There have been no expenses in maintenance of SCTs since their establishment in 2008.\nNatural \/ human environment: The technology is applied in semi-arid condition as the area receives annual rainfall of about 400 mm to address land degradation.

This technology is designed to minimize the risk of crop failure due to irregular rainfall, and to reduce peak periods (of work overload). It is a technology that can be applied in conditions of irregular rainfall cycles, in areas where it is difficult to predict rainfall accurately. The technology applies to all crop types. Applied to cotton, for example, seeding is carried out in two or three stages. If three stages are chosen, the distribution may be \u00bd of the total area planted initially, then a further \u00bc, and finally the last \u00bc. This staggered approach covers a period from two weeks to a month and one to two months after the initial rains. Most producers opt for planting crops between mid-May and the first ten days of August.\nTo facilitate its implementation, it is necessary to:\n(i) accept the risk of losing part of the seed\n(ii) be ready to seize any opportunity of adequate rainfall to perform early sowing\n(iii) combine this strategy with cover seeding techniques\n(iv) make meteorological information accessible to farmers (rural radio and other information and communication technology channels, including community radio BANIGANS\u00c9 FM in Banikoara in this case).\nThe implementation of staggered sowing effectively addresses the issue of total seed germination losses. If part of the field is lost, the chances are that another is successful. Additionally, this technology streamlines the distribution of work, preventing overlapping field activities. This, in turn, facilitates efficient labour management.\nDespite this overall risk-avoidance strategy, this technology presents a number of challenges. These include germination losses in specific sections of their fields, crop losses, and even pest attacks resulting from the selection of an inappropriate seeding period based on soil type and rainfall. Nevertheless, farmers still manage to avoid losses that might have occurred if seeding had been conducted simultaneously across the entire cultivated area.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Digital technologies|Broadcasting and radio communication|SMS","type_id":"993, 1196, 1203, 1206, 1015, 1021, 1037","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|Farm management|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|optimization of resource use for better production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 918, 910, 914, 912, 909, 915","readiness_level":"7.

The cows do not graze but are confined inside the stall, feed and water is provided for the animals.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Kamugisha Rick NelsonDue to land fragmentation and conflicts, traditional grazing systems where animals are reared in open grasslands is no longer feasible and sustainable since grassland is limited and stray animals would destroy neighboring crops. Now small holders with limited land but diversified livelihoods have to utilize the available land in full capacity and sustainable ways. For dairy farmers, stall feeding is an innovative and promising system.\nIn this practice, a Friesian cow and its calf are confined inside the built stall.  The stall has four partitions. A Calf room, milking pallor, feeding and drinking area and sleeping room. Within the feeding area is placed a wooden box of width 0.5m, length 1.5m and height 0.3m; into which feed is put for the animal. A half drum that can hold 80 liters of water is also put inside the feeding area. Both the wooden feeder and half drum are raised to a height of 0.5 m above the ground surface to prevent contamination of the feed with dung and urine; and also ensure efficient feed intake.\nThe farmer cultivated 1 acre of Napier grass (elephant grass), which provides adequate feed for the demands of the cow (75-100 kg of fresh grass per day). The Napier grass is cut, chopped and put inside the wooden box, while water is fetched from the stream and put into the half drum.\nThrough this method, the animal movement is restricted. This reduces the exposure to parasites such as ticks, and contagious diseases such as East Coast Fever. This practice also reduces land conflicts that would be caused by stray animals destroying crops of neighbors. The animal does not waste energy to look for pasture and water, hence milk productivity is enhanced. Manure is also deposited within the feeding area and thus easy to collect, decompose and apply in both farmers\u2019 crop and pasture fields.  Animals do not need to be attended to, hence farmer has more time to rest and carry out other activities.\nHowever, a lot of labor is required for cutting and chopping the grass, and carrying the feeds and water especially during the dry season. Treatment of animals and maintenance of the stall is costly and if management is poor, parasites and diseases can also build up within the stall. Stall feeding  requires feed preservation in the form of fermented pasture (silage) and\/or dried pasture (hay); stored and to be used for feeding the animals during dry seasons when pasture is dry and of poor quality.\nTo sustain this technology, the land users can supplement the feed through cultivating multipurpose tree species (Calliandra spp and Grivellia spp), leguminous forages such as lablab spp and macuna beans. Non-conventional feeds such as kitchen wastes (cassava, sweet potato and banana peelings) can also supplement the cut and carried Napier grass.COMMENTS:Map showing the technology site in Northern Uganda\nBarn, area where napier grass is planted, cut and carried.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Animal management machinery|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1195, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|animal production|animal health|livestock monitoring|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 907, 905, 910, 914, 909, 916, 921","readiness_level":"7.

Thus, most improved dairy cattle in Nepal are being reared under confinement with limited access to grazing, as it allows for easy and optimal supplementation of fodder.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Karma WangdiStall-feeding, or \u201czero-grazing\u201d, is a livestock management approach that confines animals within stalls or pens for feeding. It offers various advantages, such as improved waste management, precise nutrition control, and reduced risk of overgrazing. It allows farmers to carefully regulate their animals\u0027 diets to ensure they receive the necessary nutrition for optimal growth and productivity (Hadush, 2002). To effectively implement stall-feeding, several key components are required. Firstly, animals must be housed in separate stalls of appropriate size to facilitate cleaning and waste collection. Secondly, a well-planned feeding system is essential, which may involve the use of automatic feeding equipment, or alternatively manual distribution of hay, grains, and supplements tailored to each breed\u2019s unique nutritional needs. Thirdly, a comprehensive waste management system is crucial to handle the manure produced by confined animals, which involves thorough stall cleaning and composting, transforming waste into organic fertilizer. Proper water supply and ventilation are also imperative for the animals\u0027 health and well-being. Adhering to these technical requirements (Garber, 2010) ensures optimal productivity and animal welfare in the stall-feeding system.\nStall-feeding is employed in various agricultural contexts worldwide, particularly where traditional open grazing is impractical or unsustainable. It is applied in areas with limited grazing land and high population density, such as urban and peri-urban settings. Moreover, it may be used in arid or semi-arid regions with scarce natural pastures, as well as during dry seasons when grazing resources are scarce. Smallholder farms and intensive livestock production systems aim to maximize output while optimizing resource usage, making stall feeding a prevalent practice. Dairy farming employs stall-feeding to boost milk production and enhance the quality of dairy products (Oosting et al., 2021).\nAccording to Sahoo et al. (2015), the primary objective of stall-feeding is to provide controlled and ideal conditions for managing and feeding cattle. This approach ensures that animals are housed indoors according to their age, sex, breed, and weight, preventing them from grazing outdoors. To establish a well-functioning system, several crucial steps must be taken. First and foremost is the construction of individual stalls or pens, with careful consideration of size and design to accommodate different animals comfortably. The implementation of a reliable and well-planned feeding strategy is equally crucial. Adequate water supply and optimal ventilation within the stalls are also vital considerations (Van Eerdenburg \u0026amp; Ruud, 2021).\nOne of the primary advantages of stall feeding is its ability to provide animals with controlled and balanced nutrition, resulting in improved growth rates and higher-quality products like milk or meat. It also aids in disease prevention and mitigates the environmental impact of overgrazing. However, the main drawback lies in the additional effort and expense associated with feeding, cleaning, and waste management. Improperly managed confinement can limit animals\u0027 freedom of movement, potentially affecting their behavioral and psychological well-being. Proper ventilation and hygiene within the stalls are essential to address these concerns (Sahoo et al., 2015).\nThe type of fodder grown for dairy cattle primarily includes a variety of grasses and legumes suitable for the region\u0027s climate and terrain. Common fodder crops grown for dairy farming include Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana), Alfalfa (Medicago sativa), Clover (Trifolium spp.), Ryegrass (Lolium spp.) sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Additionally, Bhutan\u0027s traditional agroecological practices may also involve grazing on natural pastures and feeding on crop residues such as maize stalks and rice straw.\nIn Bhutan, traditional cattle breeds such as the Jersey, Brown Swiss, and local breeds are commonly raised for milk production. The milk yield per cow varies significantly based on factors such as breed genetics, nutrition, health, and management practices. On average, dairy cows in Bhutan may produce anywhere from 5 to 10 liters of milk per day, although some high-yielding breeds or well-managed farms may achieve higher yields.

The spacing of the piles depends on the slope and the availability\/abundance of surface rocks. The stone bunds, usually 0.4 meter wide is intended  to slow down run-off and catch\/impound soil that moves downslope, etiher by water or by gravity. The technology is also about the creation of small basins by removing rocks and using them as barrier. In these small basins, water is impounded and allow to infiltrate. Soil carried with the run-off is deposited in these basins for the raising of high value crops. The technology is most especially applicable in areas where limestone and other rock outcrops and where the soil is commonly shallow and skeletal. With time, natural terraces can form. Limestone\/rock outcrops are also used in the construction of check dams along small waterways. These  check dams will result in the formation of flat-bottom valleys where transplanted rice is usually grown. Series of check dams will form terraces along valley floor in the long run.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 31 km2.\nThe technology of pilling stones along the contour has been praticed for generation.

These structures serve to reduce the runoff velocity (lowering the rate of erosion and gullying in steep slope channels) and increase infiltration for groundwater recharge.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Jaclyn Bandy1. The technology is found in both natural and human environments (forest and settlement areas) \n2. Main Characteristics: A check dam or check wall is constructed in a loose or active gully or a rill (shallow channel) that threatens to enlarge, or anywhere on a slope where there is a danger of scour from running water. The structures lower the velocity of flow. In Nakina porous check walls, check dams, and retainment walls were made out of stone gathered from the surrounding area. A porous check dam releases a portion of flow through the structure, decreases the head of flow over the spillway, and decreases the dynamic and hydrostatic forces against the check dam. Porous check dams are simple and more economical for construction. \nOnce stones are collected they are cut into suitable sizes and surfaces ( \u0022dressing\u0022 of stones). The site where the technology is to be constructed is then cleared and, for check dams, the sides are sloped 1:1 (this simply refers to the ratio of the rise and run of the slope, so 1:1 means you\u0027ll have a 45 degree slope for your excavation). This is also known as the angle of repose, where the granular material of the embankment will be stable and not slump from its own weight. The base of the dam should be around 70 cm thick if it is 1 meter high. The bed of gully is excavated for foundation and dry stones are packed from that level. \n3. Purposes\/functions: Interrupts the flow of water and flattens the gradient of a channel, thereby reducing the velocity and inducing infiltration rather than eroding the channel. These structures not only slow flow velocity but also to distribute flows across vegetation. Despite some sedimentation resulting behind the dam, small cracks and porous spaces in the holes of the stones allow some sediment to flow through and the finer particles fill the gaps and strengthen the structure. Check dams can also be designed to create small reservoirs. \n4. Major activities include identifying the appropriate site of installation, collection of construction materials, technical planning of the structure dimensions and design, manual labor, and  maintenance. \n5. Benefits\/impacts: These structures decelerate runoff and accelerates groundwater recharging by storing water and facilitating infiltration of water into the soil \n6. Like\/Dislike:\nAdvantages\n\u2022Inexpensive and relatively easy to install given local building materials and labor availability\n\u2022Reduce velocity, prevent gully erosion and cause a high proportion of the sediment load in runoff to settle out, preventing downstream damage\n\u2022When carefully located and designed, check dams can remain as permanent installations with very minor regrading\nDisadvantages\n\u2022Many of these structures have a temporary nature, and need to reconstructed or removed after significant damage\n\u2022Removal or reconstruction may be a significant cost depending on the size and design\n\u2022May kill grass linings in channels if the water level remains high after rainstorms or if there is significant sedimentation.\n\u2022May create turbulence which erodes the channel banks.\n\u2022Clogging by organic material may be a problem and hinder the structure\u0027s functionCOMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Flood mitigation strategies|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1204, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|Farm management|disaster management|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"916, 920, 921, 918, 910, 1154, 922","readiness_level":"9.

The stone lines gradually accumulate sediment which leads to the gradual creation of terraces.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Wafa SaidiStone lines (or \u0022stone barriers\u0022) comprise a traditional soil and water conservation technique that has been used for centuries in Tunisia. These structures serve the dual purpose of slowing down rainwater runoff on sloping terrain and retaining suspended materials carried by the water.\nOn moderately rocky slopes, stone lines are established along the contour. Behind these barriers, sediment gradually accumulates through the effects of runoff, wind, and tillage, creating an environment conducive to the growth of trees  - such as olives, almonds, or forest varieties - and fodder shrubs.\nWhen established, the lines should have an upstream inclination of approximately 10%. The maximum height of the lines should be between 60 and 100 cm, with the downstream face sloping forwards. The spacing between two lines is determined by the slope of the terrain, calculated carefully to prevent the impact of heavy rainfall and associated runoff. It is not advisable to install stone lines on marly, clayey, or sandy soils lacking cohesion.\nCommonly, before the lines are built, subsoiling work is carried out along the contour. Maintenance is crucial for the longevity of these structures, necessitating increasing the height of the structures as they accumulated sediment. One line should not exceed 500 meters.\nThey provide a habitat for a variety of plant and animal species, fostering biodiversity and enhancing ecosystem services. Installing and maintaining these dry stone structures involves employing local knowledge, skills, and materials, encouraging community engagement and self-sufficiency \u2013 all of which are fundamental principles of agroecology.\nLand users value this technology for its many benefits and contributions to sustainable land and water management.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 921, 920, 910, 914, 918, 922","readiness_level":"9.

However, there are many hectares of very steep, stony, wind-swept slopes facing the Kagera River Valley and Lake Victoria.  These slopes have been degraded for a long time  because when it rains the runoff is very fast and carries away soil and crops. The swampy Kagera river flood plains below the slopes are fertile because of the deposits of top soil carried from the slopes. Over the last 3 years, farmers have changed from the traditional farming practice where cultivation was done with little or no protection of soil and water movement on the steep slopes to using stone lines along a contour. The stone lines are arranged along the contour to act as a barrier that slows down the speed of water and soil, improve infiltration, mitigate land slides and  trap sediment thereby reducing the extent of erosion.\nPurpose of the Technology: The technical objective of stone lines is to minimize water and soil movement down the slope and, over time, enable the building of a terrace from the accumulation of soil on the upper side of the barrier.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The stones are arranged along the contour, guided by a rope. The contour is determined using an A-Frame. The other tools required to establish stone lines are hand hoes, pick axes, and pangas. Establishment requires a lot of labor by which the following activities are accomplished: (i) stones exposed by decades of runoff on hillsides are dug up, collected and placed along contours in a field 200 m by 300 m. The width of each stone line is 0.4 m to 0.6 m and 0.5 m high. The length is dependent on the size of the field across the slope. The spacing from one line to another is 8 m to 12 m, depending on the steepness of the slope. (ii) The exposed sandy loam top soil is very dry and dusty even in the rainy season. Digging with hand hoes loosens the soil. (iii) Following the contour, circular pits of 0.45 m diameter and 0.3 m depth are dug 1.50 m apart, in the middle of every 2 stone lines. In these holes, robusta coffee seedlings are planted. (iv) Beans may be planted throughout the field as a cover crop. The farmer field school (FFS) approach is used because many farmers participate together in completing the establishment tasks. The stone lines are maintained by ensuring that stones which move off the main line are put back and the weeds which grow among the stones are removed to avoid competition with the main crops.\nNatural \/ human environment: There is no known threat to stone lines once they have been established. The runoff  cannot gather enough speed between the lines to sweep the stones away because of the short distance. The main offsite benefit is that sediment deposits and water runoff do not destroy crops in the valley below and the Kagera River is protected from silting.COMMENTS:Boundary points of the Technology area: -0.96681 31.69066; -0.96706 31.69111; -0.96717 31.69033; -0.96757 31.69038; -0.96774 31.69073\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.06 km2.\nCurrently about 3 ha but the area is still being expanded by the farmers.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Surface soil erosion is rampant, carrying away all the top soil with valuable nutrients towards  to the marshes below.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): The land is infertile and no crops can grow in that area.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Institutional|Capacity development function|Farmer field schools","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1116, 1126, 1125","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Farm management|field management|disaster management","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 918, 922, 910, 914, 1154","readiness_level":"7.

The technology was applied in community land in Sar e Ahangaran (Siakhar Toghai) watershed which drains into the main Bamyan valley forming part of the Kunduz watershed of the Amu Darya river basin. The project was initiated by CRS (Catholic Relief Services) in October 2009 and the participating families were involved in each stage of intervention, including surveys, design, and implementation and monitoring.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main function of stone wall is to trap snow and control run-off. Through construction work, many families received income through cash for work. About 21,519 USD were spent on the technology, with 90% contribution from CRS and 10% from the participating community. The cost for implementing Stone Wall technology was about 2,390 USD\/ha.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The technology was applied in extensive grazing land. The stone wall technology is not new to the farmers of Sar e Ahangaran (Siakhar Toghai) as they have applied it in their private croplands as well. CRS built on this traditional technology and improved it by applying it along contour lines demarcated with A-frame and establishing it a more technically sound manner. The technology is effective in reducing snow avalanches, surface run-off, sediments, and downstream flooding leading to more crop production and less destruction of property and crops. It is tolerant to increasing or decreasing temperature and droughts. If constructed properly along the contour, the technology is not impacted by heavy rainfall or severe flash floods.\nNatural \/ human environment: The technology was applied on hill and mountain slopes at 3000-3500 m elevation. The average annual rainfall in the area is 250-500 mm. The longest growing period is 6 months, i.e. from April to September. Due to its proximity to the Koh-i-Baba mountains, the area experiences long, severe winters of around 6 months (Mid-October to mid-April). \nThe participating families are poor; 10-50 % of their income is from off-farm activities, e.g. labour, migration. The villagers have moderate access to health, education, technical assistance, drinking water and sanitation facilities. Accessibility to employment, markets, energy, good roads and financial services is poor. The production system is subsistence-oriented and non-subsidized. \nThe effectiveness of stone wall technology was strengthened through other SLM measures, including contour trench bund, gully plugs, shrub cutting and grazing control, planting trees below the walls, and re-sowing with improved fodder species.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Degradation of slopes due to biotic pressures such as overgrazing, extraction of bushes for fuel and cultivation leading to snow avalanche, flash floods and decrease in spring water quantity.

Some new terraces are, however, still being built. The walls are constructed with limestone, largely found on site. The terraces are located in steep terrain (usually on slopes more than 25%) under low (and erratic) rainfall regimes of between 250 and 500 mm per annum. The terrace walls are 1-2.5 m high and the level beds 3-25 m wide, depending on slope.\nDeep soil profiles (more than 2 m) have developed on steep slopes, where original soil depth was only shallow to medium. The terraces are very efficient in preventing soil erosion and in the retention of rainfall. They support trees and annual crops where they could not otherwise be grown.\nThese terraces are usually found near settlements. Construction is very labour intensive, considering how little land is effectively protected from erosion and brought into cultivation. High labour investment makes the construction process slow and retards further extension of the technology. However, if soundly constructed, maintenance requirements are low. Underlining this point, a large number of very ancient terraces can still be found intact, supporting a productive crop. Sometimes localised collapse of a terrace occurs due to concentrated runoff. In that case, the terrace in question may need to be rebuilt. To prevent such breaches, it is important to allow for discharge of excess runoff along drainage lines.\nCurrently, most terraces are used to grow fruit trees. These include olives, cherries, almonds, plums, pomegranates, apricots, and peaches. Husbandry practices are normally carried out by hand. Where space permits, however, draft animals are used for tillage. The curves of the terraces and access to the steep slopes make it very difficult\/impossible to use tractors. Animal power is more versatile in this irregular landscape, but it is more expensive than tractor power, due to shortage of fodder.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Before terracing, water erosion resulted in shallow to medium colluvial soils.

These are structural measural measures placed along the contour to control soil erosion and trap runoff.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Daniel DananoStone-faced soil bund is constructed during the dry period when the field is free from crops (after crop harvest). Soils in the woreda are light and are easily eroded. A contour line is marked on the ground first and a foundation placing stones is dug. The stone wall is placed in the foundation and the wall is raised until it attains a height of 0.50m at minimum. Then earth is dug on the upslope side by removing soil from it and make an embankment of soil on the upper side to support the stone wall. In the same way the stone is supported by the soil from the upper side. The embanked soil is lightly compacted to avoid collapse. The objective is to control concentrated runoff from causing soil erosion and to retain as much rainwater as possible in the soil for mazimizing crop production. Livestock are not let on the terraced land. Most land users feed their animals tethered. The bund is then stablized by planting grass. The most commonly used grasses for stablizing bunds in the area are phalaris and elephant grass. The purpose is to control runoff and soil erosion from cultivated lands. Grass is planted to stablize the bund and also help in providing fodder for animals. Some land users stablize the stone-faced bunds by planting fruit trees. Fruit trees are often planted at the homesteads for better management and protection. The income obtaoned from fruit trees is high. Sorghum fields are predominantly treated by stone-faced bunds while chat and coffee fields are treated by ridges and basins. Frequent maintenance and upgrading is required until bench is formed. Currently most of the fields in the woreda have a properly stablized terraces and as a result loss of soil and water by erosion is decreasing. Maintenance is done continuously until the structure stablizes well and inparticular after heavy rains, every time after tillage and cropping. The technology is suitable in areas where stones are avialable and soils are light.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 80 km2.\nInformation obtaned from annual activities and achievements reports. But at present the total technology area is more than the amount shown here and estimate is indicated as follows:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Land use problem is the result mainly of high population growth, improper land use and poor farming practices. Land not suitable for cultivation is put under use. Steepslopes on hillsides and mountain escarpments are cultivated. These have resulted in high runoff and sediment movment from the upper catchments which are dominantly devoid of vegetation and no conservation measures practiced.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): land shortage, loss of fertility and soil erosion on lands with no conservation measures.\nCut-and-carry\/ zero grazing: grazing land is seriously shriniking owing\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: sorghum-beans or chat - sorghum, maize-beansSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Production|crop production|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|Farm management|field management|income increase","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 922, 897, 898, 920, 918, 910, 914, 1180","readiness_level":"9.

They are particularly common in areas where rocks are readily available, such as Mbeere, Laikipia, Baringo, Mwingi, Kitui and Tharaka. Since the stonelines are permeable they do not pond runoff water but instead, they slow down the speed, filter it and spread the water over the field, thus enhancing water infiltration and reducing soil erosion. They are built in series running along the slope. In addition, the stone barrier blocks and settles down the sediments transported from the upper slopes.\nPurpose of the Technology: They are often used to rehabilitate eroded and abandoned land. The advantages of stonelines include; slowing down the runoff thereby increasing infiltration and soil moisture. They also induce a natural process of terracing, reducing erosion and rehabilitation of eroded lands by trapping silt. They are easy to design and construct and since the stone line structure is permeable there is no need for construction of spillways to drain the excess runoff water. When it rains, the soil builds up on the upslope side of the stonelines and over time a natural terrace is formed.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The stonelines are spaced 15-30 m apart, a shorter distance being used for the steeper slopes. Stonelines are normally suitable on gentle slopes. Slopes above 35% should be avoided. They are established in the following manner: first, the contour line are marked out with the help of a tube level or line levels. In this region here, it is done with the help of the frontline agricultural extension officers. Secondly, a shallow foundation trench is dug across the slope (5-10 cm to 30 cm deep) using basic farm equipments (jembes or hoes). As shown on the above photographs, the larger stones are put on the down slope side of the trench while the smaller stones are used to build the rest of the bund. The smallest stones are used to fill the gaps and increase the heights of the bunds up to the desired level. Farmers plant fruit trees (pawpaws) as show in the photograph above on the upper part. The trees utilises the moisture and rich sediments deposited on the upper part. The stonelines can be reinforced with earth, or crop residues to make them more stable. Maintenance of stonelines is done by repairing the already damaged \/fallen stoneline that may have been knocked down or disarranged by livestock or by human beings. In this case animal access needs to be limited and\/or the bund should be laid out in a way that allows the animals to pass through.\nNatural \/ human environment: In the lower Mbeere South District where the stoneline technologies is largely practiced, unless there are stones in the individual farms, it might be difficult to import stones from other farms as the exercise can be labor intensive. In this catchment, the Ministry of Agriculture through the front line extension officers has taken a lead role in encouraging farmers to adopt the technology especially the farms which have many stones. Most of the farmers who have implemented this technology in the Lower Mbeere South District learn from the ones who are already practicing through field days or individual initiatives.COMMENTS:Not many farmers are practicing stonelines, the farmers who are practicing are copying from some successful farmers within their neighborhood. They also corroborate with the local agricultural extension officers from the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) to show them how to construct the stonelines along the contours.Major crop: Sorghum, maize, mangoes, pawpaws, miraa, millet, cowpeas \nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Limited cultivation land due to hindrances that are brought about by the scattered stones on the land\u0027s surface.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Soil erosion because of lack of soil and water conservation structures that leads to low land productivity.\nFuture (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Cropland: Ca: Annual croppingSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 920, 918, 922, 917","readiness_level":"7.

The Chengdu plain has mild climate and abundant rainfall. It belongs to the warm humid subtropical Pacific monsoon climate zone.The main types of soil in the Chengdu plain are paddy soil and purple soil.The total land resources of the Chengdu plain are 1331800 hectares, and the per capita land resources are about 0.1044 hectares per person. In 2010, the total amount of cultivated land in the Chengdu plain was 478069 hectares, accounting for 35.90% of the area of the plain, accounting for 42.36% of the total area of agricultural land in the region, and the per capita arable land area was only about 0.0375 hectares. The Chengdu Plain is an important grain production base in Sichuan. Rice field-upland field rotation (rice - wheat, rice - rapeseed) is an important agricultural system.\nOn the case study area, the N, P and K fertilizers were applied as urea, calcium superphosphate and potassium chloride at the rates of 120-150 kg N ha-1, 75-120 kg P2O5 ha-1,and 75-120 kg K2O ha-1, during every crop. During crop season, the rate of 60% of N, 100% of P, and 50% of K fertilizers were applied as base fertilizer, while remaining 40% of N and 50% of K were used as top dressing fertilizer. The main measures of this SLM is rice straw or wheat straw mulching while havesting (leaving the straw after havest scattered on the field). Crops were harvested by a combine harvester (Kuotian combine harvester, model PR0488), then straw and stubble of crops were left at size of less than 20 cm in the field. The seeding of succession crop such as wheat and oil seed rape is done by a direct seeding machine. The land users are working eighter with a contractor or they use their own machines and labour force. The purposes of this technology were to increase production and improve soil fertility. Although plough layer can become shallow by long-term no tillage cultivation, more and more land users like this technology because it promises increased grain yield, reduction of fertilizers (and subsequently cost), and it improves soil physical, chemical and biological properties of soil. Thus, it is expected that the measures of this SLM-Technology ends up in improved soil moisture, higher diversity of soil life and finally soil fertility .COMMENTS:This long-term straw mulch experiment was started in the 2005.

Indeed it is now a legal requirement in South Africa for mining companies to rehabilitate mined areas to a condition and productivity equivalent to the pre-mining situation.\nThe primary purpose of the technology described here is to achieve this result \u2013 thus allowing the site to be used again for extensive grazing by sheep and wild animals. Revegetation also reduces wind erosion. The technology further contributes to increasing biodiversity, as particular attention is given to planting a range of locally endemic and other indigenous species.\nThe sequence of operations is as follows: during strip mining operations the topsoil is pushed to one side by bulldozer, and stockpiled. The substrata is then excavated mechanically, removed by tipper truck, and processed to extract the heavy metals. The tailings (waste materials) are returned by tipper truck to the area from which they were mined, and then levelled by bulldozer. The stockpiled topsoil is returned and spread by bulldozer over the levelled tailings. Indigenous succulents and other plant species are dug out by hand, with a spade, from either the surrounding areas of natural vegetation, or from the piles of topsoil (where plants may have naturally established) and transplanted manually into the newly spread topsoil. The planted areas are protected from wind erosion by erecting fine mesh nylon netting as windbreaks. These are 0.8 metre high and 5 metres apart. The nets are usually installed for a period of up to 2-3 years. Subsequently they are removed, once the vegetation has successfully become re-established, and they may be re-used at the next rehabilitation site. Maintenance activities continue for a few years \u2013 until the site is rehabilitated. An individual mine strip is usually about 1 km long and some 100 m wide.\nThis form of strip mine rehabilitation has been in operation since 1990, and costs on average just over US$ 200 per hectare, with all expenses met by the mining company. This particular approach was developed for the Anglo-American subsidiary \u2013 \u2018Namaqua Sands\u2019. A similar approach was adopted by \u2018PBGypsum Mines\u2019 located further inland, where rehabilitation is also conducted on several hundreds hectares of mined land.

In the strip tillage tool, sub-surface wings are attached to the ripper tine to increase the width of soil disruption which the ripper will be unable to achieve in moist soil. The sub-surface wings loosen the soil by lifting it slightly and letting it fall in place without inverting it. In this way, a strip of soil with a width of around 20cm is tilled up to 20cm deep and this is where the crop will be planted. The region between the strips is maintained as a no-till region for soil and water conservation.\nPurpose of the Technology: The strip tillage tool is meant to be a transitional technology for farmers intending to adopt Conservation Agriculture (CA) in degraded soils. These soils will need routine loosening while the biological activities allow the soil structure to recover sufficiently until tillage is no longer required. Strip tillage is able to achieve deeper soil loosening with much less draft force, wear of tines and soil disturbance than ripping. The untilled region between the strips enables the benefits of soil cover such as improved infiltration, soil water storage and increased soil organic matter. Soil loosening by strip tillage does not produce large clods like ripping does but instead produces a fine seedbed that enables uniform emergence of the crop, and this together with the deep penetration results in early plant vigour. The strip tillage implement is also designed to allow the attachment of a planter unit to enable tillage and planting in one operation.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The establishment of strip tillage based conservation agriculture mainly involves the purchase of the strip tillage implement and the replaceable tines. Liming acidic soils (low pH soils) followed by a final ploughing will be required to correct the soil PH which otherwise will be difficult to correct once conservation tillage has been established. Maintenance activities include strip-tilling the soil which may or may not include planting and fertilizing in the same operation. Weeding should preferably include the use of herbicides, implying that the major operations will include spraying. In addition to the normal conventional inputs, herbicides will also become a major input and cost.\nNatural \/ human environment: The strip tillage technology is most suited to the bigger small-scale farmers with a capacity of 5ha to about 20ha. The strip tillage tool together with the planter will require a relatively substantial investment and only the bigger farmers will fully utilize its capacity. The strip tillage action will not be very effective in wet soils especially in the heavier soils, soil disruption is best achieved when the soil is slightly moist but not too dry as to require to high draft forces. Strip tillage is useful in soil with poor structure that will require routine loosening to maintain yields while the soil is being rehabilitated.COMMENTS:The strip tillage technology is only in its second year of promotion and 7 farmers had adopted the technology in the 2011\/12 season.

The topsoil of HBT is grey silt loam to silty clay loam, is strongly puddled and has a compact ploughpan at the base. Deep grey terrace soils and grey valley soil are the major components of the general soil types of this area.          \nStrip tillage wheat cultivation is being adopted in farmers field on which wheat has been cultivated for decades. Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) developed this technology\/innovation, and Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) disseminated the technology also among farmers of Rajshahi region. In brief, strip tillage wheat is a water saving technology, and requires wheat to be planted in rows. Traditionally, farmers cultivated wheat using the broadcast method, after deep tilling the land 3-4 times and after flood irrigation. In this new method, farmers can use a strip tiller that sows seeds and fertilizer simultaneously immediately after T. Aman rice (Transplanted rice, Aman is the Kharif 2 season from June to November) harvesting. This implies that retained soil moisture can germinate the wheat seeds. Because the wheat seeds are sown in a row, sunlight and air penetrate very well; and weed infestation remains low because of minimum tillage. Farmers report that rodent infestation in strip tillage is lower than conventional broadcast cultivation. \nAs stated, a strip tiller is needed for this operation, and the machine is a modified version of traditional power tiller developed by BARI. The tiller has thin ploughs in parallel rows (four to a machine), and drops the fertilizer and seed \u2013 another wheel-like device presses the seed into the soil. The other parts of land remain unplowed that keep moisture and resist weeds to grow. Retention of rice crop residue increases soil organic matter which in turn increases the soil water retention\/holding capacity and loosens the soil (for free drainage). \nOverall, this water saving technology has increased livelihood options for tiller machine service providers, decreased on-farm input costs (e.g., irrigation, rodenticide), and increased wheat productivity (by improve weather \u2013 storm\/wind \u2013 resistance of crops and reducing rodent infestation). Moreover, it produces quality wheat, increases the grain weight, and makes wheat easy to harvest. The yield of strip cultivated wheat is reported to be 1.25 times higher than conventional wheat.COMMENTS:Farmers are cultivating strip tillage wheat in their own fieldSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Production|crop production|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|optimization of resource use for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|equipment management|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 908, 909, 916, 920, 921, 910, 914, 1180, 912, 913, 918","readiness_level":"9.

The soil over the whole field is protected by a growing crop or mulch from sunlight, and especially from the direct impact of raindrops by providing permanent soil cover.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Felix WitingConservation agriculture includes cultivation systems with minimum tillage or without tillage (no-till). Minimum tillage uses machinery (cultivators, rotary tillers) that only loosen the topsoil layer without turning it, leaving a mixture of bare soil and crop residues from the previous crop\/ cover crop on the surface. No-till refers to sowing and fertilizing directly into the plant residues. Strip-till is a hybrid, where only the strip around the seed furrow is minimum-tilled, leaving up to two-thirds of the area under no-till.\nStrip-till increases surface roughness, which slows the flow of surface water after heavy rains, improving infiltration rates and particle deposition, thus preventing soil erosion, nutrient losses and degradation of water quality in downstream channels and rivers. The plant residues reduce soil crust formation and decrease evaporation rates (Gangan et al. 2022). The residues also improve biological activity and the build-up of soil organic matter (SOM) and clay-humus complexes. The increased SOM content improves water storage capacity and thus water use efficiency throughout the growing season (Stadler, 2014; Busari et al. 2015).\nStrip-till seeding is a precision farming technology that requires a high precision GPS guidance system and specific machinery, such as seed drills to cut through crop residues. The distance beween the strips depends on the cultivated crop. For maize cultivation it is typically 75cm. Strip-till machinery is often heavier than conventional seeding drills because the undisturbed soil is denser and harder. Often a new tractor with more horsepower is needed to compensate for the heavy weights. If mulch seeding is used, grain harvesters equipped with well-designed straw\/chaff spreading devices across the full cutting width are required (Corsi \u0026amp; Muminjanov, 2019).\nStrip-till also has negative side effects, which are related to the disadvantages of no-till: delayed soil warming, soil compaction, increased disease pressure, and increased weed pressure. Without ploughing, other measures such as selecting fast-growing and effective ground cover species, early high-density seeding, and\/or using herbicides are needed to control weeds, especially in the transition period (first 2-3 years) when the seed bank in the soil is well-filled.\nIn our documented example, the farmer used strip-till on sandy soils (lacking nutrients, with  poor water-holding capacity) and combined it with the application of organic fertilizer. Specifically the strip-till seeding of maize was chosen to make efficient use of digestate from a biogas plant. The digestate is applied in the tilled strips (seed bed) providing organic fertilizer for the whole growing season. A winter-killed catch crop was sown before drilling maize. The technology required expensive machinery and equipment, such as a Volmer Strip-Till Culex ML, RTK station and GPS guidance system. However, the costs were recouped through savings in fuel and fertilizer.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Vehicles and machinery|Digital technologies|GPS|Geospatial technologies|Advanced positioning systems|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1194, 1015, 1028, 1052, 1055, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Production|crop production|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|optimization of resource use for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|water use optimization for sustainability|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 908, 909, 916, 921, 910, 914, 920, 917, 918, 919, 922","readiness_level":"9.

They are totally submerged into the ground. For example by fully covering after construction by sand. This are done along dry rivers with huge sand deposits, which has high yield potential and where water can be easily extracted. The aim is to raise groundwater tables and increase the storage capacity for water withdrawals.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Guyo RobaThe technology is applied in northern rangeland of Isiolo County which is managed under communal management systems. The aim of technology to reduce pasture and water availability imbalances. The dimensions of sub-surface dam include: a length of water spread (103m),width of the dam (15m), width of water spread (18m), effective dam height (2m), volume of retained sand (103 x 0.5(15 +18) x0.5 x2.0 = 5098.50m3) and the volume of water that can be abstracted from the sand bed (25\/100x 5098.50m3 = 1274.6.36m3).\nThe technology functions as underground water storage infrastructure  and the typical activities include, excavation of top porous soil, excavation of sample pits within the excavated area, checking filtration rates of soil, compaction of soil on which dam liners are laid, smoothing the sharp liners along which the dam liners are laid, making grooves to anchor the dam liner, laying the dam liner, anchoring the dam liner with a mixture of cement, water proof and sand with water (motor) and finally drying of the motor and filling back of sand.\nThe development of Sub-Surface Dams (SSDs) was done through Cash for Work program where local labours comprising of 40-50 persons are engaged in excavation, compactions and developing the liners. Farm tools like jembe, panga, spades and human labour are required to develop the SSD. The technology improves water supply\/availability, thereby extending the period of livestock grazing in areas where typically water is depleted before the pasture hence improves water access for livestock in ways that support wider management and utilization of the rangeland and as such strength the resilience of pastoralists to droughts. This effectively gives pastoral groups, an extra grazing time (typically 2 extra months), a period usually not too long to encourage land degradation through over-grazing but long enough to enable pastoralist utilize the remaining pasture in wet season grazing areas. In so doing, the technology enable balanced use of vast communal lands without livestock retreating to dry season grazing areas.\nIn the process of the landscape level participatory planning with the communities: i) they identified different challenges, including need for decommissioning certain water points that they consider are contributing to over grazing and also attracting other communities, hence drive frequent conflicts, secondly, ii) they mapped areas in the rangeland where there is mismatch between water and pasture availability, most of these areas are in wet season grazing areas. So the next discussion was on what strategic water infrastructures that will enable herders to graze for 2 -3 extra months to enable them utilize the grass before they migrate to the traditional dry season grazing areas. So by design, the technology should only yield water that can allow settling for those extra months, not longer to the detriment of the rangeland\nThe technology was instrumental in fostering both balanced utilization of land and strengthening sustainable use of the vast rangeland by ensuring that herders utilize available pastures in the wet seasons grazing areas before moving to dry seasons grazing areas.  The water stored through the technology stays longer, in this case study, the water lasted for 5 months after the end of the rainy season  .\nThe area receives bimodal rainfall, long rain in March-May and short rain in November-December. With changing seasons\/climate, the dry seasons can last up to 1 year in case of rainfall failure. Typically, dry seasons are 6-7 months (May- November).\nNormally, the water is depleted within 2 months after the rainy period. The technology is also cheap and easy to understand and construct (especially in areas with clay as the underlying impermeable material) with a possibility of the communities to be taught how to identify suitable site and the entire process of construction. However, in areas without clay soil, the excavation of clay and transportation can be labour intensive and expensive.COMMENTS:Communal grazing area that is shared by 2 and more pastoral groupsSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1203, 1206, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|disaster management","use_cases_id":"897, 1186, 899, 916, 918, 920, 910, 914, 1154","readiness_level":"7.

Sub-surface water is filtered by gravel\/sand underground and infiltrates into the gallery. The harvested water is used for household needs as well as for livestock and irrigation through gravity flow.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Eveline StuderThis method is applied in areas with low rainfall, where soils have a sandy-gravelly texture and where the sub-surface water can not percolate deeply, but instead flows laterally in shallow sub-surface channels. The technology consists of the following main elements: filtration materials (sand \/ gravel), collection chambers, perforated pipes, conveyance lines made from solid blocks, and storage tanks. Construction includes the following main activities and inputs:\n\u2022 Excavation of rectangular trenches with machinery or by hand\n\u2022 Construction of a solid base line with PCC (plain cement concrete) blocks on the top of boulders\n\u2022 Installation of perforated and blind pipes - and storage tanks where necessary\n\u2022 Coverage of the trench first with boulders and then sand on top.\nOnce the gallery is constructed there is no further need for intervention; this means that maintenance costs for the user (farmer, households of the local community) are minimal. Traditionally, the technology has been implemented by local farmers for many years. Where improvements are required, support by local technicians is provided. The technology is based on local knowledge, and locally available construction materials. The method is technically simple, cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Farmers and other users consider this technology as very efficient as there is no need for external energy supply, and it can be easily replicated. Furthermore, it requires a minimum of external construction material and the operation costs are minimal. The captured water is filtered through the subsurface layers and - as long as there is no specific external contamination - it is safe and can be used for various purposes as already noted. This extra water supply is particularly effective for irrigation, contributing to increased production and allowing diversification of crop production (potentially also of high value crops), thereby improving the livelihoods of remote rural communities. The primary impact of this technology is to reduce risks related to droughts or water scarcity as natural phenomena or consequences of climate change effects. Additionally infiltration of water into the galleries reduces surface erosion of fertile soil, hence it lessens soil degradation.COMMENTS:This technology is suitable for area with little slope to retain a maximum amount of water. when the stream bed has a higher gravel content, it provides more water.

Submerged drains diminish the differences between ditch level and groundwater level in the fields by enabling the infiltration from ditch to field and the drainage from field to ditch.\nIn summer and dry periods the infiltration from ditch to field is much lower than the evapotranspiration of the grass, resulting in a lowering of the groundwater level some decimetres below ditch water level. With submerged drains the groundwater level is lowered less drastically because infiltration from ditch to field is improved. In winter and wet periods, fields are drained more quickly compared to conventional drainage.\nPurpose of the Technology: Submerged drains diminish the differences between ditch level and groundwater level in the fields by enabling the infiltration from ditch to field and the drainage from field to ditch. Under peak rainfall events groundwater levels become less high and remain at high levels for shorter times than in fields without submerged drains.\nDue to the increased groundwater level in summer the decomposition of the peat soil is reduced. As a result, the rate of soil subsidence is decreased and also the emission of greenhouse gases and of N and P released to the surface water.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The installation of submerged drains is done with common drainage installation machines. Submerged drains should be installed between 15 and 25 cm below the ditch water level, and between 45 and 75 cm below the soil surface. The drain pipes should have a diameter of at least 6 cm. The distance between drains is at most 6 m. Drain length is at most 300 m. Submerged drains can be installed in the length or width direction of a field. Drains must be installed level.\nNatural \/ human environment: Submerged drains were designed for peat soils under permanent pasture for dairy farming. More than 70 % of Dutch peat soils are under this land use. Drainage of these peat soils results in subsidence, mainly by decomposition (oxidation) of the peat (partly by shrinkage and consolidation). This is an ongoing process, because every 10 to 15 year ditchwater levels are adapted to the lowered surface in order to enable dairy farming and to prevent the conversion to wetlands. Soil subsidence causes several problems: decreased suitability for grazing and grassland farming, increased flood risk, emission of greenhouse gases, damage to infrastructure (dikes, roads, foundations, sewerage networks) and increased cost of water management. \nSubmerged drains were tested with a network of practitioners and 10 dairy farmers in the Dutch peat soil area between 2011 and 2013 on an area of 20 ha.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.054 m2.\nThe measure was tested in three pilots in the areas Krimpenerwaard, Keulevaart and Demmerkiksekade. Each pilot covered two fields: one with submerged drains and one without. The area given refers to the pilot in the Krimpenerwaard.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The major land use problems in the Western Dutch peat soil area is soil subsidence due to the lowering of the groundwater level in the 1960s and 1970s. The soil subsidence amounts to 0-2.5 cm per year. It is mainly caused by the oxidation of peat soil, which releases nutrients to soil and surface water, and CO2 and N2O to the atmosphere. The soil subsidence causes several problems:\n- damage to buildings and infrastructure\n- increasing costs of water management: high groundwater levels require pumping of water to enable agricultural use, and storage of rainfall excess water during peak rainfall events\n- drainage of nature reserves to lowered agricultural land\n- water pollution: the lowering of the groundwater level causes upward seepage of nutrient-rich water to polders\n- greenhouse gas emissions (2-3% of total CO2 emissions in The Netherlands)\n- loss of peat soils (2% per year in the NL)\n- increased flood risk (due to combination with sealevel rise)\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Grassland and arable farming are hampered by high groundwater levels due to a lowered bearing capacity and too wet conditions for crops. Maintaining the groundwater level at a level high enough to prevent the decomposition of peat soil would imply a conversion to wetlands and forest swamps. This is not acceptable to various kinds of land users (nature managers, farmers, users of built-up area). This would also mean the loss of the cultural historic open landscape and habitat for meadow birds, strongly reduced economic possibilities and an increased demand of water from the rivers (view of water managers and governments).\nFuture (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Grazing land: Gi: Intensive grazing\/ fodder production\nLongest growing period in days: 270Longest growing period from month to month: April-October\nLivestock density: \u003E 100 LU \/km2SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Flood mitigation strategies","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1204","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change mitigation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|water use optimization for sustainability|Production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Farm management|field management|disaster management|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"916, 919, 921, 922, 920, 897, 899, 1186, 910, 914, 1154, 918","readiness_level":"7.

Subsolier is pulled by a tractor and chisels (tines) break up a compacted layer below the surface. Subsoiling disturbs this dense layer and loosens the soil. This treatment improves air-water relations in the soil. The depth of subsoiling can be adjusted.  On heavier soils, deeper subsoiling may be necessary. The farmer surveyed (who has a medium sized enterprise of about 400 ha) subsoils at a depth of 40-45 cm. Subsoiling is used especially for root crops such as sugar beet - and for other crops to a lesser extent, depending on the needs and condition of the soil. It is possible to adjust the spacing of the chisels (tines) and the power of the tractor. An average spacing between the chisels is 50 cm. A 200 horsepower tractor is able to pull a five-tine subsoiler. If time permits, the whole field should be subsoiled. Subsoiling takes quite a long time (about 10 ha per day). This technology is required every year when sugar beet is planted. In other fields, only machinery tracks and headlands (where the machine turns) should be subsoiled every year. Subsoiling is often used after harvest and before other field operations such as ploughing etc. On average, due to crop rotation, the whole field is only subsoiled once every four years.  Subsoiling is a form of tillage which can be used instead of traditional ploughing to loosen soil without inverting it: thus it can form part of a reduced tillage system.COMMENTS:Most often used as a part of conventional tillage technology, as an additional activity. Subsoiling is performed on about 25% of total farm area.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Vehicles and machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1194","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 921, 909, 912","readiness_level":"9.

Various solutions are tapped and one of it is harnessing the potential of wastewater to be used for irrigation.\nIn the Philippines, one of the companies that utilize their treated wastewater is the BUSCO SUGAR MILLING CO., INC. located in Brgy. Butong, Quezon, Bukidnon. This treated wastewater is currently being re-used as irrigation water for the BUSCO Cane Farms areas, adjacent to the Mill Site covering 493 hectares and also to their leased adjacent 323-ha agricultural land.\nPrimarily, water as an industrial by-product is evident in both raw and refined sugar milling process. Volume of wastewater can be generated in the following sources or stations of sugar production: mill and cane handling station, process and\/or boiling house, refinery house, and boiler house. In BUSCO, this wastewater all goes to their common wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 100,000 volumetric meter and uses primary and secondary treatment.\nThe treatment started with the screening of influent (waste water) which passes through a motor driven conveyor type system to separate the solid waste such as bagasse, bagacillo, silt\/mud, sand, and trash canes. After the screening, it now proceeds to the oil\/grease separation at the separator tank. Oil and grease that usually floats were removed via manual skimming. The next treatment process is called neutralization wherein the acidic influent (phof 4.0\u20135.0) will be added with chemicals  (i.e. Lime  and\/or  caustic  soda)  to  neutralize  and   maintain  the  pH  at 6.0\u20138.0. The neutralized wastewater is then impounded in a digester tank to undergo the process of digestion. Enzymes or bacteria are being introduced to enhanced biodegradation. Aeration is also applied to minimize suspended solids and scum formation.  After this, wastewater is transferred to the lagoon for primary aeration process. Lagoons are belted with air diffuser membrane to produced fine bubbles and efficiently dissolved oxygen. Waste water was aerated and polluting substance decomposed. Further, the wastewater and the activated sludge are again mixed and aerated in the secondary and tertiary aeration where the polluting substances are further decomposed by oxidation and are absorbed. Finally, it will store in the final settling pond which will then be utilized for irrigation. The treated wastewater in BUSCO has a Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) value of 50mg\/L which is within the prescribed standard BOD parameters of wastewater quality to be used for crop irrigation (\u003C 150mg\/L).\nIrrigation is done through the hand move spray irrigation system. It uses aluminum pipes backed by centrifugal pumps and spray nozzles. Aside from supporting the sugarcane water requirement particularly during dry months, the treated wastewater\/effluent contains nutrients (Nitrogen- 2.5mg\/L; Phosphorus- 3.8 mg\/L; Potassium- 3.8 mg\/L) which reduce fertilizer requirements of the sugarcane farm.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Biotechnologies|Bioremediation and phytoremediation","type_id":"993, 1188, 994, 1000","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|optimization of resource use for better production|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 920, 909, 921, 910, 914, 918","readiness_level":"7.

They also collect and impound subsurface flow. Dohs are built in semi-arid areas where rainfall is low and seasonal. The dimension of a typical doh is 1.0-1.5 m deep with variable length (up to 40 m) and width (up to 10 m) depending on streambed section, with an average capacity of 400 m3.\nPurpose of the Technology: The excavated material is deposited along the stream banks as a barrier against siltation from surrounding areas. The slopes of the excavation are gentle (an upstream slope of 1:6 or 17% and a downstream slope of 1:8 or 12%) so that water flows into it, and excess water out again, carrying silt rather than depositing it. The sides however are steep, to increase capacity - and would benefit from stone pitching to stabilise them. A silt trap comprising a line of loose boulders is constructed upstream across the streambed. Dohs are generally built in sequence. They may be as close as a few metres apart. Bends in the stream are avoided as these are susceptible to bank erosion.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The technology is used in conjunction with shallow wells (odees), which enable farmers to harvest the increased groundwater for supplementary irrigation of annual crops- including vegetables such as chilli peppers. Water is pumped out of the wells. In the case study village, Mohanpada, each doh basically supplies an underground source of extra water to one well. Communities together with project staff carry out site selection, and then detailed design\/estimates\/layout is done with project technical assistance. As a supportive measure the catchment area is treated with gully plugs (small stone checks in gullies). A water harvesting tank (small reservoir or dam) may be excavated above the series of dohs where this is justified by a sufficiently large catchment area\/suitable site. The capacity of the tank at Mohanpada is around 600 m3 and thus also has a positive impact on groundwater recharge.\nNatural \/ human environment: Maintenance is agreed through meetings of user groups: manual desilting is planned and repairs of gully plugs also. In summary, dohs are low cost water recharge alternatives for poorer communities, and in this case study, the extra area brought under production has meant that all families that require it, now have access to some water for irrigation.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.1 km2.\nThe project area for phase 1 comprises 18 villages (3314 Households) mainly tribal. A significant portion of the area is barren and used for open grazing. The sunken wter harvesting technology was initially demonstrated in few villages as an alternative to the high cost heading type approach to water harvesting bieng implemented on a large scale by main line programmes.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): There are regular poor yields of agricultural crops on the degraded, rainfed fields. A further constraint is the limited amount of water in wells, restricting both the extent of irrigation, and the number of people with access to irrigation. There is an underlying problem of poverty, which in turn leads to seasonal out-migration to find work.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Agricultural lands: sloping fields, soil loss, poor yields. Common lands:competition from surrounding villages for grazing resulting in low yields. Private pastures (bir): small patches which are not sufficient to meet the fodder needs. Settlement area: 28 huts already erected. Additional space not available.\nOther grazingland: extensive grazing: on patches of waste lands within fields\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: During monsoon (kharif) season the main crop is cotton + maize.  In addition minor pulses are taken. If water is available for irrigation, this is followed by wheat+gram in winter. Major area is fallow in winter except for the cotton crop which is of longer duration.

However, the average yield per hectare remains low. Here, rice production heavily depends on rainfall, but distribution is inconsistent. Additionally, soil fertility is low, with a rapid decline in soil organic matter (SOM). Another significant threat to productivity in this area is salinity, with 17% of the rice production area affected.\nThe Land Development Department (LDD) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives has promoted the use of soil amendments, such as green manure plants - including sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) - to enhance organic matter and restore soil fertility under saline conditions. Green manures are ploughed under, and incorporated into the soil to achieve their effect.\nIn the Non Thai district of Nakhon Ratchasima province, farmers face water shortages during the dry season, as the area lies outside the irrigation zone. Farmers, along with officers from the Land Development Department, have worked to increase SOM in degraded soils through knowledge transfer. Volunteer soil doctors and local farmers have adopted technologies that combine SOM improvement with soil and water conservation measures.\nOne notable example is Mr. Mana Siangsuthia: since 1997, he has collaborated with LDD officers, receiving beneficial microorganisms (PD microorganisms), green manure plants, vetiver grass, and water resources for his paddy fields. He has implemented LDD guidelines to develop his 1.12 hectare rice plot. Previously, this land was unproductive due to soil degradation caused by long-term monoculture of industrial crops and excessive use of synthetic fertilizers.\nFermented bio-extracts from banana shoots and chemical fertilizers were applied according to recommended guidelines. In 2004, rice yields averaged 1,125\u20131,550 kg\/ha. Continuous implementation of these practices raised yields to 2,500 kg\/ha by 2011. Over 16 years, using sunn hemp as a soil amendment significantly improved soil aggregate stability and reduced salinity. This success led to a shift towards natural agriculture practices in 2013, where chemical fertilizers were no longer used.\nFarmers in the area now employ weather observation techniques and efficient water management strategies during dry spells. Green manure plants are sown every two years, complemented by the cultivation of salt-tolerant rice varieties, which also exhibit drought and pest resistance. These practices have resulted in rice yields of 3,125\u20133,750 kg\/ha.\nAfter rice harvesting, rice straw and stubble are ploughed in together with banana shoot PD 2 bio-extract. After approximately 2 weeks of decomposition,  sunn hemp is sown at the rate of 31.25 kg\/ha.  When sunn hemp reaches 120 days, its seeds are collected.  Then sunn hemp stems of around 1.2 meters height are ploughed in order to obtain more biomass.\nWater conservation remains a focus in the cultivation area. During the rainy season, excess rainwater is stored for use during dry periods. Additionally, farmers employ techniques to wash salt from the soil surface into drainage channels. Water quality is enhanced using fermented bio-extracts, ensuring adequate water for dry-season cultivation.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biologicals|Biotechnologies|Biofertilizers and biopesticides|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 2100, 994, 1001, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1206, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 908, 909, 910, 914, 912, 916, 917, 918, 920, 921, 922, 926","readiness_level":"9.

Furthermore, SI provides the opportunity for a more diverse production system such as a legume-cotton system in which chickpeas are cultivated as a winter crop, and soybean and cotton are inter-cropped in the summer.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Joren VerbistThe state of Madhya Pradesh (India) has an average annual rainfall of around 1170 mm. However, data shows a declining trend. It is characterized by a monsoon period from July to September. Winter is from December to January and the summer is from February to March. The rainfall is irregular, resulting in crop failures, land degradation, nutrient leaching and shortened growing seasons. This constrains the agricultural sector, upon which 74% of the population is either directly or indirectly dependent. 38% of the agricultural area is intensively\/conventionally irrigated. The majority of the water is obtained from groundwater which has led to over-exploitation.\nTo sustainably improve the agricultural sector, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) introduced Supplemental Irrigation (SI). This is a practice in which essentially rainfed crops are cultivated rather than more water demanding crops. SI ensures a su\ufb03cient amount of water as rainfall satisfies the majority of the crop water demand. Water availability is not sought in (fossil) groundwater extraction, thus avoiding over-exploitation, but rather through rainwater harvesting (RWH), using the rainfall optimally. In addition, SI prolongs the growing season and enables more diverse farming systems by crop rotation and inter-cropping.\nIn 2018, a reservoir was constructed, with a 900,000 litres capacity. Every rainy season groundwater rises to the surface, indicating that the soil is fully saturated. The reservoir is filled by pumping the surface water from shallow wells. This is considered sustainable RWH as it assumed the pumped water is solely rainwater. An additional benefit of this approach is that no large catchment area is required. The building of the reservoir consists of 1) excavating the soil; 2) stone pitching the excavation; 3) installing polysheet to avoid water losses through infiltration. The water from the reservoir is distributed over the field by a portable (wheeled) sprinkler irrigation system. Hence, pumping from the reservoir is required.\nThe water from the reservoir allows for crop rotation with a winter crop, namely chickpeas. This crop grows from November till March, outside of the rainy season. Without SI, chickpea yield is poor as farmers must wait until su\ufb03cient rain has fallen before sowing, limiting the growing period. SI can provide the necessary water for the chickpeas to germinate well, ensuring a su\ufb03cient growing period. The chickpeas are manually harvested in March. Besides increased income for the farmer, chickpeas also provide valuable soil improvement as the plant fixes atmospheric nitrogen in the soil.\nIn additional to crop rotation, SI and water harvesting allows for a more intensive cropping system in which cotton and soybean are intercropped. These crops are planted in June-July. The intercrop ratio is two rows of cotton and six rows of soybean. Soybean and cotton are respectively threshed and harvested in October. Consequently, the plants are grown mainly in the rainy season. Fertilizer (80 kg nitrogen, 100 kg phosphorus and 60 kg potassium per hectare) is applied directly after sowing, hence June-July. In the same period the field is manually weeded. Micro-Nutrients (a mixture of B, Zn, Mn) are applied if needed. On average, this corresponds to one kilogram per hectare. Mechanical pesticide application is done from July to August by a sprayer, consisting of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides.\nThe frequency and amount of irrigated water through SI is unpredictable as it compensates rainfall irregularity. Nevertheless, it is advised to irrigate less than the infiltration rate of the soil, to avoid deep percolation of water and nutrient leaching. That is, it is better to irrigate small doses multiple times. For this reason, sandy soils are unsuitable as they have relatively high infiltration rates and low water holding capacity. On average, one hectare of this particular production system is irrigated through sprinklers thrice by 250 cubic meters of harvested water.\nA great advantage of SI is that it leads to a year-round income through a diversified production system with an additional winter crop. Farmers also value SI ensuring stable yields, thus making them less vulnerable to rainfall irregularities. Also, the diversified system protects the crops better against epidemics. And as there are legumes included in the system, the soil quality is improved, lowering the required amount of nitrogen fertilizer.\nNevertheless, SI has some weaknesses. For example, the implementation of SI is di\ufb03cult for smallholder farmers as they lack the area for a reservoir. In addition, the initial costs are high, so adoption may be restrained by the lack of available funds, especially for smallholder farmer. This specific SI, by water harvesting (extracting shallow groundwater) is not suitable in areas of poor groundwater recharge. But the concept of SI can be applied. To conclude, where it is technically and financially feasible, SI allows for more intensive, diversified and stable production system under climate change induced risks, hence supplemental irrigation is an important technique to improve the livelihoods of farmers exposed to climate change.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1203","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|optimization of resource use for better production|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 916, 918, 920, 921, 914, 912, 909, 917","readiness_level":"7.

It is an organic charcoal material that is the final product of pyrolysis, or high-temperature burning of agricultural biomass without oxygen. Surplus crop residues, agricultural waste, and wood from sustainable sources are used as feedstock (raw material). Such biochar production is linked with agroforestry plantation and agriculture to improve soil health and ensuring sustainable feedstock availability.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Santosh GuptaIntroduction and Background\nIntensive cropping systems coupled with monocropping and high usage of synthetic fertilizers have led to the degradation of soils and depletion of nutrients directly affecting agricultural productivity and farmers\u0027 income. Farmers in the Balangir district of Odisha are facing similar challenges. To address these issues and promote sustainable farming practices, a biochar production initiative was introduced by utilizing crop residues and waste material from forests to produce biochar, a carbon-rich material that enhances soil fertility and soil structure. The initiative is a part of the Pro-Soil Project of Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), India and implemented by the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF). The technology (a kiln for biochar production) and technical inputs for biochar production were sourced from the Indian Institute of Soil Science, Bhopal.\nBiochar is a type of charcoal produced from biomass like agricultural or forest waste or organic materials through a process called pyrolysis. The application of sustainable biochar technology in agroforestry systems can lead to better soil structure, increased water retention, reduced nutrient leaching, and improved crop yields. Moreover, it aids in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by locking carbon into soil for an extended period.\nIn the project region farmers used crop residues such as rice straw, wheat straw and residue of other crops along with non-usable biomass from local forests, such as branches, twigs, and leaves, to supplement the feedstock for the pyrolysis. Since the District has large forest areas, the availability of forest waste is no problem. The biochar produced was applied into existing crops fields as well as into agroforestry system. Aiming to promote agroforestry, the project promoted the integration of trees (both fruits and timber) and shrubs into existing agricultural practices. Agroforestry offers multiple benefits such as improved soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. When sustainable biochar production is integrated into these systems, it can create a sustainable cycle where agricultural waste is converted into biochar, which then enhances soil fertility and sequesters carbon when added back into the soil.\nThe project has actively involved women farmers, entrepreneurial youth, and farmers\u0027 groups in the collection, production and application process of biochar thus promoting community participation and creating awareness about the benefits of biochar.\nImplementation\nThe biochar kiln technology, obtained from the Indian Institute of Soil Science, in Bhopal, is employed to convert biomass into biochar through pyrolysis. This technology ensures efficient and controlled production of high-quality biochar. The collected biomass undergoes a controlled pyrolysis process inside the biochar kiln, where it is burned in the relative absence of oxygen. Technical specialization during production includes kiln temperature control, feedstock preparation, and the management of pyrolysis gases to ensure efficient biochar production. This results in the conversion of biomass into biochar, also leaving behind bioenergy-rich gases. Quality control measures are implemented to ensure the production of biochar with optimal characteristics, including high carbon content, porosity, and stability.\nThe Biochar kiln used was designed with the aim to optimize temperature control and ensure efficient conversion of biomass. An efficient loading mechanism allows easy and controlled feeding of biomass into the kiln. This ensures a consistent flow of material during the pyrolysis process. Although local kilns are usually not equipped with temperature control mechanisms to regulate the pyrolysis temperature, the temperature in the kilns may alternatively be regulated through the rate of feeding biomass into the kilns. Such kilns usually have some safety features and proper ventilation so to prevent accidents.\nTo implement this technology the ICRAF conducted training sessions for farmers on the proper preparation and application of biochar. The trainings were focused on the following aspects:\n-The collection and drying process for agriculture and forest waste\n-The management of operations for the biochar kiln including the loading of raw material (feedstock) into the kiln, its burning, operation-timing, period check, volumes of raw material to be fed etc.\n-Precautions to be taken during the process\n-The quality check of prepared biochar charcoal and the process for pulverizing it\n-Dosage recommendations for different crops as per local conditions\n-The mixing of biochar with cow dung and cow urine before application\n-Integration with existing farming practices and the long-term benefits of biochar on soil health\nImpact and Knowledge Transfer\nThe biochar acts as a soil conditioner, enhancing water retention, nutrient availability, and microbial activity. The benefits and impacts on improved fertility, increased water retention, and reduced nutrient leaching, lead to higher crop yields and resilience against climate variability, carbon sequestration aids in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change, and utilizing agricultural residues reduces air pollution from open burning and provides a sustainable solution for organic waste disposal. Land users appreciated the enhanced soil productivity and environmental benefits brought by biochar. Overall, the Sustainable Biochar Production Technology represents a promising approach in sustainable agriculture and environmental stewardship.\nThe project team, in collaboration with local agricultural extension services and the Indian Institute of Soil Science, monitored the impact of biochar application on soil health parameters. This involved regular soil testing, crop yield assessments and feedback from participating farmers. In fact, they also measured the impact of biochar made from different feedstock (raw materials). Success stories were shared with neighboring communities, public stakeholders and researchers and encouraged the further adoption of sustainable soil management practices.\nThe biochar production initiative in the Balangir District of Odisha in India demonstrates a sustainable approach to addressing soil health issues using locally available resources. Through the collaboration between ICRAF and GIZ, this project not only improves soil fertility but also empowers local communities by providing them with sustainable solutions for agricultural challenges. The success of this intervention serves as a model for future initiatives aimed at promoting environmentally friendly and community-driven approaches to agriculture.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Manufacturing technologies|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1009, 1044","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Production|crop production|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Farm management|income increase|forestry management","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 919, 922, 897, 898, 917, 910, 1180, 927","readiness_level":"7.

The small perennial streams which flow through the terraces are protected by constructing check dams and retaining walls to reduce the danger of erosion and collapse.\nPurpose of the Technology: During the monsoon, the channels or trenches can become engorged and, since their walls are not reinforced (except for grass planted at the edges), the conduits can be easily eroded. When the erosion is severe enough, the edges of the terraces adjacent to the gullies can collapse. When many gullies collapse at once, the stability of the entire hillside is threatened with catastrophic consequences for the village situated above the planting area. Villagers have traditionally used local materials and expertise to maintain the gullies and reduce soil erosion by building retaining walls across the slope which are strengthened through plantation. The retaining walls are bio-engineered using a combination of bamboo poles, rocks, and soil-filled sacks. Bamboo poles are used for the backbone of the support structure, and rocks and soil-filled sacks are used to line the sides of the channel. Local grasses such as \u0027sitto\u0027 are planted on the top and, as they grow, their roots help to anchor the structure. When the channels are fortified by retaining walls and planting, they become entrenched and, over time, less maintenance is required. As a bonus, when the plants grown along the gullies mature, they provide biomass for the farm and fodder for cattle. During winter, when water is scarce, farmers modify the gully system by constructing check dams which can be used to collect water in one place. These dams are useful for irrigation during the dry season and they also help to prevent bed scouring.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 1.1 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): As the land is continuously eroded, both farmland and inhabited areas will slowly slide downhill.\nForest products and services: timber, fuelwood\nOther forest products and services: Fodder\nConstraints of wastelands \/ deserts \/ glaciers \/ swamps\nLivestock density: \u003C 1 LU\/km2SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|disaster management|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|forestry management","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 910, 1154, 918, 920, 927","readiness_level":"9.

To increase production, samata can be vegetatively propagated with cuttings raised in a nursery. The advantages are: (a) protection against livestock, (b) selection of the most appropriate planting stock to propagate and (c) easy watering. Cuttings should only be taken from mature trees 7-10 years old and 3-4 m high. The mother plants should be healthy, with few spines, and no previous cuttings taken. Cuttings are taken at the upper nodes of the branches, approximately 20-25 cm long and 0.5-1.5 cm diameter. Transport of the cuttings to the nursery should be carried out in the morning to avoid heat. For effective rooting, the cutting is planted 5 cm (1-2 nodes) into a humid substrate in a plastic pot or directly into the ground. Best results are achieved using white sea sand mixed with some organic material. Cuttings should be raised in a sunny location. During the first 15 days, the cuttings need to be watered once every morning. For the next 3-4 months, they need watering every second morning. 24 hours before transplantation from the nursery to the final destination, the cuttings should be abundantly watered. Rooted cuttings are transplanted into pits of 10 cm diameter and 15 cm depth, filled with the same substrate as used in the nursery. For 15 days, the transplants are watered on a daily basis, and afterwards every second day. After 30-45 days, the transplants are ready to survive without further care. If the planting location is open to roaming livestock, the cuttings need protection.\nPurpose of the Technology: The samata tree naturally reproduces by seeds as well as by vegetative reproduction. However the German funded SULAMA research project has had most success with multiplication of the local variety with cuttings. This form of propagation is preferable as it is much faster and gives higher survival rates of the individuals: neither does it need much planting material, equipment or technical knowledge. Providing the villagers with the know-how, and assisting them to create local samata-nurseries, makes this technology promising. SuLaMa-WWF started this technique in April 2015, establishing 5 nurseries with 2,000 trees each (3 with village communities, 2 with local schools).\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: On the coastal plain of the Mahafaly plateau region, the climatic and edaphic conditions do not support livestock raising based mainly on grasses. For 6-7 months, the herders are dependent on supplementary fodder plants, especially samata. The tree is fed by cutting its branches and slicing them. However pressure on this resource has led to depletion of stocks around many villages: this results from increasing demand and reduced supply. Higher demand is the result of changed herd movements, especially a shorter transhumance period. Lower supply is attributed to decreased precipitation, overuse of trees leading to poor regeneration or even the death of trees, and reduced samata areas due to the expansion of private crop fields. The overuse of trees is triggered by the overall scarcity of this resource as well as an ongoing privatization of the historically common land resources.COMMENTS:Application ongoing, the envisaged implementation area might be up to 1,000 km\u00b2.Major cash crop annual cropping: Maize\nMajor food crop annual cropping: Cassava\nOther crops annual cropping: Sweet potato\nMajor cash crop tree\/shrub cropping: Samata (Euphorbia stenoclada)\nOther crops tree\/shrub cropping: Cactus\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): : Climatic constraints (especially low and erratic precipitation), deforestation, forest degradation, soil degradation, overgrazing, loss of arable land, fragmentation, low availability of surface and (very saline) ground water, privatization of common pool resources.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Climatic constraints, loss of arable land, low availability of animal fodder, soil degradation, low availability of surface and (very saline) ground water.\nSemi-nomadism \/ pastoralism: Yes\nCut-and-carry\/ zero grazing: Yes\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: samata trees are both found on the grazing area (naturally), as well as on agricultural fields (naturally, transplanted).

In contrast to current destructive wild bee honey harvesting, members of the Abril family keep the traditional practice of capturing\/rescuing wild nests, and adapt them so that honey can be extracted from the same nest for many years (up to 30 y) without killing the bees.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Beatriz RamirezNative bee honey production in the floodable savannahs of the eastern Colombian Llanos (Orinoco River Basin), relies on stingless bees of the species Melipona favosa. These bees nest inside tree trunks. The main characteristics of the native bee keeping, as currently performed by three generations of the Abril Family, is that it is sustainable, promotes de conservation of native ecosystems, and as far as we know, constitutes the only sustainable and profitable direct use of local biodiversity in the floodable savannahs of the eastern Llanos in Colombia. Its sustainability is due to the adaptations and management of the nests, so that honey can be extracted without damaging the bees. On one hand, they know how to retrieve wild nests, either by rescuing them from rotten trees or the ground, or by cutting the branch with the nest, and then keeping its natural position at all times. Once at their houses, they will study the outside of the nest and listen to the bees inside the nest, with this information they will cut out a part of the tree trunk to create a window. Once opened, they verify the location of the honey and pollen pots and the broods. Then, they will reattach the cut part on to the trunk by using metal wire and sealing the edges with mud. The nest will be hanged with wire in the position it was originally found. Once on site they will check every day for the presence of the sentinel bee and bee activity. Furthermore, they only extract honey during the end of the dry season when bees have enough food reserves. For the extraction, they will reopen the previously cut window, and extract the honey and pollen pots, making sure enough are left behind so that bees can have access to food as well. The mean honey production from each nest is around the 750 ml- 1000 ml. Honey is kept for their own use and sold to some people for a fairly high price (30 dollars per 750 ml). The honey is mainly consumed as a medicinal product, and its low quantity makes it highly sought after. If someone requests it for sight issues, H\u00e9ctor will extract the honey with a syringe so that it is as clear as possible.\nThe native bee keeping contributes to protect native bees, as the management of nests can keep them functional for up to 30 years. The Abril family members are well aware of the dependency between honey production and presence of native plants from where bees forage for nectar and pollen. Therefore, they avoid forest clearing and selectively keep shrubs in the grasslands to guarantee food supply for their bees. Also, they plant fruit trees such as guayaba (Psidium guajava) and araz\u00e1 (Eugenia stipitata), that benefit the bees, which at the same time benefit pollination. Fruit production is mainly used for home use and very seldom they are sold. They also witness the negative impacts that agrochemical airborne dispersion from rice production in the neighbouring farms, have on wild bee populations. So far, their main concern is that they do not know how to multiply the nests.COMMENTS:All farms are neighbors and they all belong to the Abril family members (Father, two sons and a daughter)The main economic activity of this group of farms is extensive cattle ranching on natural floodable savannhas (242 ha), but they all have bee keeping in their houses. The number 80 refers to the nest quantity. They preserve gallery forests (108 ha) and allow for fallows (28 ha) to develope near the houses for supplying nectar and pollen to the bees.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Pollinator-friendly practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Native species utilization|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation|Grassroots innovation networks|Low-cost farming tools and techniques","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1202, 1206, 1201, 1076, 1088, 1090, 1089","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Farm management|income increase","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 910, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

Specifically, a local sweet potato variety called \u201cmayaman\u201d is planted one to two months after planting rice\/corn and is being cultivated in the field in between the rows of the above-mentioned main crop. The \u201cmayaman\u201d variety is selected by the farmers due to its excellent food quality and ability to produce more roots at its vine, enabling staggered harvesting and extending period of utilization. However, in some instances, rice and corn were planted at the same time.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of using creeping type of sweet potato is to provide cover to the soil which addresses soil moisture conservation primarily during growing period and after main crop harvesting time. It also protects the soil against erosion. Moreover, it provides additional and alternative food source for the farmers, in case the main crop fails due to some reasons.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The main crop, either corn or rice, is planted first with a specified planting distance--75cm between rows and 75cm between hills with 2 to 3 seeds per hill (for corn) and 30cm between rows and 20cm between hills with 5 to 6 seeds per hill (for rice). After one month, the sweet potato cuttings are planted in between rows of the main crop at a distance of 1.5m between hills.\nNatural \/ human environment: This relay cropping system is locally known as \u201clapat\u201d in the areas of Matalom and Bato, Southern Leyte where it is commonly practiced.The soil in these areas is characterized as mostly acid soil.

He worked with Malagasy farmers and colleagues to improve the possibilities of rice production. The practice contributes to both healthier soil and healthier plants, supported by greater root growth and the nurturing of soil microbial abundance and diversity. It is based on a number of well-founded agro-ecological principles. SRI concepts and practices have also been successfully adapted to upland rice.\nSRI involves transplanting very young rice seedlings (usually 8-12 days old with just two small leaves) carefully and quickly so as to cause minimum disturbance to the roots. The seedlings are planted individually, in contrast to the traditional method where clumps of 3-4 are planted together, minimising root competition between the seedlings. The seedlings are kept widely spaced to allow better root and canopy growth, in a square grid pattern at a spacing of at least 25 x 25 cm. Planting can be done even wider at 30 x 30 or 40 x 40 cm and even up to 50 x 50 cm in the best quality soils.\nThe soil is kept moist but well drained and aerated to support increased biological activity. A small quantity of water is applied during the vegetative growth period following which a thin layer of water is maintained on the fields only during the flowering and grain-filling stages. Better quality compost, such as well decomposed farmyard manure, can be applied to achieve additional yield increases. Since weed growth will be more abundant and will be a problem in fields that are not kept flooded (and because of the wider spacing), weeding needs to be done at least once or twice in the first 10-12 days and a total of three or four times altogether before the canopy closes.\n SRI does not require additional inputs like new seeds, chemical fertiliser or pesticides, but it does require the skilful management of the factors in production and, at least initially, 25-50% more labour inputs, particularly for the transplanting and weeding. As farmers become more skilled and confident in SRI, the amount of labour needed decreases and can eventually become the same or even less than with conventional methods.\nSRI is being tried out by farmers in many areas of Nepal\u2019s middle mountains including in the Jhikhu Khola watershed. This area has an altitude of 800-2200 masl, and receives about 1200 mm annual rainfall, about 70-80% in the monsoon months (June to September).COMMENTS:This was the first year of on farm research cum demonstration on the farmers field after the trial in the research station.

Irrigation water supply requirements are lower, which means the approach can be deployed in low-rainfall areas or the rice growing areas can be extended using the same quantity of water (climate change adaptation). The technique requires less seed and fertiliser.\nSRI optimises the soil-water-plant relationship. It increases the plants\u2019 potential for production by correcting disadvantageous practices. In practical terms, this involves growing rice on lowlands and plains using fewer seeds (with the rice variety selected according to the water regime) and less fertiliser.\nThe system of rice intensification proves that rice is not strictly speaking an aquatic crop. Rice growing simply requires a very humid environment. The water level is maintained considerably lower down the rice stalk than it is in traditional rice paddies, where water levels range from 10 to 25 centimetres.\nSRI makes it possible to increase yields by around 35% compared to average yields. It has been possible to cut costs given the shorter growing season (90 days). Growers reduce seed use by 8 to 10 kilograms per hectare. Water use drops by around 35%, given that the rice is not constantly submerged and water levels in the paddy are low.\nImplementation: Firstly, the growers are sensitised and informed about the principles and benefits of SRI in terms of yields and production costs, and are given the opportunity to sign up for technical training in SRI. IICEM takes charge of monitoring the proper application of the SRI methods over the\ngrowing season. Seedlings are planted out individually to ensure each plant has sufficient space to grow. The rice plants are grown individually in rows, which reduces the number of seeds required and makes weeding easier.\nOperation: 1) Selecting the most appropriate rice varieties according to the water regime of the area in question (rainfed rice and lowland rice). SRI rice crops adapt well to flood and recession waters, meaning rising and falling water source levels can be managed. 2) Respecting the irrigation cycles developed with the planner: An irrigation cycle is drawn up with a planner. Training is then provided to the growers managing the irrigation system to ensure they adhere strictly to the cycle. It is important for growers in the same hydraulic area to plant out at the same time so their irrigation supply needs correspond. This ensures that the water requirements of the rice crops are met and reduces pumping costs.\nRoles of the actors involved: IICEM delivers training to raise awareness about SRI and provide the relevant skills. Conscious of the need to increase yields, IICEM ensures that this learning is applied in the field. Sometimes local NGOs are tasked with providing training and monitoring. Growers apply the SRI approach and monitor inputs and yields so that operations can be effectively evaluated.\nThe practice was rolled out in the Mopti, Timbuktu and Gao regions of northern Mali and in Sikasso in the south. Two very small-scale rice fields were installed: one in Deibata in Youwarou Circle and one in Mopti. Farmer organisations supported by IICEM are benefiting from the technique.

It is considered to be a relatively new technique, developed by mountain dwellers who migrated to the plains. Tabias, like jessour, comprise an earthen dyke (50-150 m in length, 1-2 m in height), a spillway (central and\/or lateral) and an associated water harvesting area. The ratio between the area where water is applied (cropped area) and the total area from which water is collected varies from 1:6 to 1:20. The differences between the tabia and the jessour systems are that the former contains two additional lateral bunds (up to 30 m long) and sometimes a small flood diversion dyke (mgoud). Small tabia are constructed manually using shovels, pickles and carts. Larger constructions are done mechanically using tractors and bulldozers.\nPurpose of the Technology: Tree products and annual crops are commonly grown using tabia. Besides their water harvesting qualities, tabias also have a positive effect on soil erosion and groundwater recharge.\nNatural \/ human environment: The tabia runoff-water harvesting technique is widely practised in central Tunisia.

Ceci conduit \u00e0 des inondations en aval, et induit des destructions d\u2019infrastructure et de terres cultiv\u00e9es tr\u00e8s couteuses.\nEn automne, des fr\u00eanes sont taill\u00e9s toutes les quelques ann\u00e9es \u00e0 plus de 2 m du sol. Ceci forme les arbres en t\u00eatard, \u00e0 un ou plusieurs troncs. Le b\u00e9tail est nourri avec les branches, car le feuillage constitue un tr\u00e8s bon fourrage.\nLe but de la taille des fr\u00eanes est de nourrir le b\u00e9tail \u00e0 long terme, sp\u00e9cialement en temps de difficult\u00e9s environnementales, l\u2019automne.  L\u0027arbre, du a son enracinement profond, est moins sujet aux al\u00e9as de la m\u00e9t\u00e9o que les plantes \u00e0 enracinement peu profond, sp\u00e9cialement les cultures annuelles. La taille \u00e0 une hauteur que le b\u00e9tail n\u2019atteint pas de lui-m\u00eame permet de g\u00e9rer les ressources fourrag\u00e8res en \u00e9vitant un surp\u00e2turage, qui est principalement d\u00fb \u00e0 une r\u00e9currence trop fr\u00e9quente du broutage, avant que la plante se soit r\u00e9tablie. Les arbres taill\u00e9s sont anciens, la plantation ou la mise en d\u00e9fens de jeunes fr\u00eanes ne se fait pas par la population dans la zone de Midelt.\nVu que les arbres dans les parcours sont principalement sur des terres domaniales dans lesquelles les \u00e9leveurs ont des droits de p\u00e2turages, la taille des fr\u00eanes est ill\u00e9gale, comme tout \u00e9branchage. Par contre, le surp\u00e2turage de jeunes fr\u00eanes, qui est plus probl\u00e9matique d\u2019un point de vue environnemental, n\u2019est pas sanctionn\u00e9. De ce fait, une discussion ouverte avec les \u00e9leveurs sur l\u2019utilisation des arbres comme fourrage est difficile.\nCOMMENTS:Seulement une petite s\u00e9lection de fr\u00eanes taill\u00e9s en t\u00eatard est montr\u00e9e.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206, 1198, 1197","use_cases":"Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|livestock monitoring|animal health|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|forestry management","use_cases_id":"897, 1186, 899, 905, 907, 916, 921, 918, 927","readiness_level":"7.

The practice was started in Malaysia in 1896 and because of the increase in average annual temperatures in Uganda, it is gradually gaining momentum in Uganda. \nThis technology was established on 1.6 ha of land out of 10 ha owned by the farmer. It lies on a gentle slope and stretched to the wetland. On one  field  citrus (citrus sinensis) was planted as the major crop the other crops grown include; maize (zea mays) local variety and cassava an improved variety (manihot esculenta) NASE14. \nThe citrus is grown for purely commercial purposes, the maize and cassava grown for food security and also provides shade for the young citrus trees especially during the dry season. \nEstablishing the system involved bush clearing and ox ploughing.  Digging planting holes, applying manure and drainage channels dug after the seedlings had firmly established.\nThe citrus seedlings were planted in 90 cm \u00d7 90 cm \u00d7 45 cm (width \u00d7 length \u00d7 depth) planting holes, excavated to conserve soil moisture during prolonged dry spells. The citrus spacing was 8 m \u00d7 8 m. \nWithin the citrus field, 30cm \u00d7 30 m mini drainage channels were made to drain excess water during the rainy season.  The cassava was planted at 1 m \u00d7 1 m between the spaces of the citrus seedlings and then the maize was staggered within the field. Approximately 500 citrus seedlings were planted within the 1.6 ha. \nIn Taungya systems, the annual crops provide shade for the young trees and generate leaf litter which acts as mulch for moisture conservation and also enhances soil fertility. Taungya systems also increase household income because they allow crop diversification within the same field. The drainage channels reduce flood incidences on the field.\nThe system has a few challenges, for example during harvesting of cassava the citrus roots can be damaged, which affects their performance. \nEstablishing the drainage channels was labor intensive, thus the channels fall short of the recommended 60 cm recommended width.COMMENTS:3.01642,   32.12677, The location lies in Pabbo sub-county Amuru District.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|income increase|improved plant varieties|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 1180, 902, 916, 921, 918, 917, 915, 912","readiness_level":"7.

The stem is placed upright and later covered with soil. If there is adequate rain then some tip of the stem is left exposed but if rainfall is inadequate then the stem tip is covered in order for the plant to have enough moisture for its growth. It takes two weeks for the tip to get exposed on the surface when fully covered. The plant automatically appears with two leave lets. \nThe leaves when exposed to excessive sunlight can dry up and this retards its growth. This may require watering by the land user. At the early stage, the teak plantation can be inter cropped with beans and other crops such as sesame since the teak plantation has not yet formed a big canopy. This can be done for two years and later only slashing within the plantation needs to be done to maintain the plantation. The dry fallen leaves also kill weeds hence easing maintenance work. The trees are to be protected from fire outbreaks during dry season. In the month of November, fire lines are to be created and the dry leaves collected to mulch the plantation. \nThe cost of establishing a Teak plantations is high in the first 2-3 years but reduces significantly after first thinning. The cost of weeding can be reduced by spot-weeding of seedlings up to age 3 years, after which slashing or spraying with herbicides, usually Round-up is used for weed control. Wood from thinning is also sold as firewood or construction poles to recover some the establishment costs. \nShedding of teak leaves is heavy during the dry season and this causes a risk of fire. It\u2019s advisable at this stage that the land user puts in place fire lines, an open space of 6 meters to separate the plantation into compartments in order to restrict fire from spreading from one part to another part. \nTeak plantations are good at responding to dry conditions and can provide high-quality timber which in turn provides income. Teak trees provide hardwood timber, poles and modify the micro-climate through evapotranspiration. Fencing is done using bulb wires to avoid damage by wild animals and encroachments. The teak trees occupy land for a long period of time that can be used for other purposes like planting food crops. The piled dry teak leaves may harbour dangerous animals like snakes. Community members also complain about too much rainfall brought about by the plantation.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|New business models","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1197, 1206, 1076, 1211","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|Farm management|income increase|field management|climate change adaptation|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"916, 927, 910, 1180, 914, 918, 915, 921","readiness_level":"7.

In northern Uganda, farmers are establishing plantations of Teak for timber production as opposed to other plantation species like Pines and clonal Eucalyptus.\nSeeds are raised in pots, small seedling containers in which they grow into seedlings. When the rains start, usually around April, or September, the seedlings are planted out, with 1,100 seedlings planted per hectare. Teak trees are planted at a spacing of 3 x 3 meters and thinned at 5 and 9 years to retain approximately 450 trees per hectare. To ensure that the timber produced from the trees does not have knots, pruning is done to remove lower branches as the tree grows. Pruning is normally done starting at the age of 3 years. Like most tree planting projects, framers tend to plan Teak on less productive land, leaving the fertile parts of their land for food and other high-value cash crops.\nThe cost of establishing a Teak plantations is high in the first 2-3 years but reduces significantly after first thinning. The cost of weeding can be reduced by spot-weeding of seedlings up to age 3 years, after which slashing or spraying with herbicides (usually Round-up) is used for weed control. Wood from thinning is also sold as firewood or construction poles to recover some the establishment costs. Shading of leave by Teak is heavy during the dry season and this causes a risk of fire. Therefore, fire control is done by establishing a fine-line, an open space of 6 meters to separate the plantation into compartments in order to restrict fire from spreading from one part to another part. \nFarmers like Teak because it endures dry conditions and can provide high-quality timber.  Although not exploited yet, these Teak plantations can be used for carbon trade and further improve the income of the farmer. What farmers do not like about Teak is that unlike several other specie where livestock can be integrated in the plantation, it is not possible for teak because it does not support undergrowth.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)","type_id":"993, 1196, 1203, 1199","use_cases":"Production|forest products and logging management|improved plant varieties|Farm management|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|carbon credit management to monetize sustainable practices|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|field management|forestry management","use_cases_id":"897, 901, 902, 910, 1180, 912, 916, 918, 923, 915, 914, 927","readiness_level":"9.

It is a technology of easy application by farmers, which is carried out according to the degree of degradation of the pastures. In the case of pastures that have large amount of grasses, but their vigor is low and forage production is slow, it is recommended to recover pastures. When the grass population is low and the pasture has been invaded by other species that cannot be used to feed the livestock, it is necessary to renovate pastures.\nFor the recovery, vertical tillage as chisel plow is recommended, at a shallow depth to avoid the damage caused by the agricultural machinery. This tillage has to be complemented with fertilization with minerals such as phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N).\nFor the renovation of pastures, the used species are Urochloa decumbens, Urochloa humidicola, Urochloa brizantha, and other hybrids of Urochloa. It is recommended more intense tillage of the soil through mechanical implements, such as the spike harrow or disk harrow, complemented with fertilization. In addition, soil cover, N content, and soil nutrition can be improved by introducing legumes such as Pueraria phaseoloides cv Kudzu tropical, Stylosanthes capitata cv Capica, Desmodium heterocarpum cv Maquenque, or forage peanut (Arachis pintoi).\nIn the renewed grasslands the forage production increased by more than 100% for at least three consecutive years. On the other hand, as a result of the efficient association of forage legumes with grasses, animal productivity is 50% higher than in pure grass pastures fertilized with 50 kg\/ha of nitrogen.\nPasture improvement is a good SLM practice since it results in a higher vegetation cover that protects the soil and, over time, leads to an increase in organic matter and soil biota.\nThe grassland recovery and renovation should be complemented by good grazing cattle management, which is restarted 2 to 3 months after the treatments have been applied. It is recommended to divide the paddocks for rotational grazing to allow the grasses to rest and produce new shoots and avoid overgrazing, which can cause further deterioration of the pastures.\nWith the renovation and good grassland management, animal production increased by 160-300% compared to degraded grasslands. On the other hand, daily milk production per cow increased by 22%, and milk produced during lactation in one hectare increased by 175%.\nIn the improved pastures, more animals can be grazed on a smaller area, which reduces the area devoted to livestock farming and reduces the pressure on forests that have traditionally been cleared for pasture.COMMENTS:Gramineas forrajeras:\nUrochloa decumbens cv Decumbens o amargo\n Urochloa humidicola cv Humidicola o dulce, cv Llanero\nUrochloa brizantha cv Toledo, cv La Libertad, cv Marandu\nh\u00edbridos de Urochloa: cv Mulato, cv.

Teff is commonly planted in broadcast technique with a seed rate of 25-30 kg per hectare. This practice results in high competition for nutrient and water, lodging and low productivity (on average 1 ton\/ha). Teff row planting is a newly adopted planting method applied for small size seeds of Teff grain. The row planting technique reduces the seed rate from 25kg\/ha to 5-8 kg per hectare, ease the weed management, reduce lodging problem, and lessen plant density and then competition for sunlight, nutrient and water. It is practiced on Teff growing soils except on heavy clay soils or Vertisols where it is difficult to prepare defined rows due to the extreme swelling nature of the soil under near saturation moisture condition. However, under optimum soil moisture (45-50%) it is possible to place seeds in row using manual seed drill in black soils with clay texture. The technique is not perfectly working on stony fields. Seed application is possible using locally available plastic bottles with needle size opening to drop seeds, and newly manufactured seed drill pulled by one person.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose to practice Teff row planting is to reduce plant density or population per unit area and thereby increase productivity. It also aim to reduce the lodging problem. Additional advantage of row planting for small grain crop, there is some extent of labor reduction for weeding to some extent.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Teff row planting technique applies on fine seed bed after 3-5 tillage frequency using local ard plough called maresha pulled by pair of oxen. Once the seed bed is finely prepared, first using local adopted application tools like plastic bottles or hand metering the farmer prepares seed rate of 5-8 kg per hectare mixed with proportional sand (approximately seed to sand ratio of 1:3) - it is difficult to manage uniform application and even distribution by applying the seed alone. He applies along the row and step on to cover the seed and compact it. Similarly, fertilizer is applied in the same way. Second option, after the preparation of fine seed bed, seed application is facilitated using drum type manual seed drill (of weight 21 kg) manufactured by Bahir Dar Agricultural Mechanization and Food Science Research Center (BAMFSRC) having 3 rows of 20cm apart, average depth and width of planting furrow equals to 3.6 cm and 6.4 cm and operating at field capacity of 0.06ha\/hr. The drill can apply 3-6 kg\/ha seed rate and pulled by one person. At tillering stage urea is top dressed. The technique requires 50-60 person days per hectare to apply seed and fertilizer using hand metering\/bottles compared to 2-4 person days per hectare using drum type seed drill. Labor requirement for weeding is also reduced by using row planting than broadcast method.\nNatural \/ human environment: Teff grows on wider environment of altitude range 1800-2600 m above sea level. It performs well with annual rainfall of 750-850 mm and temperature of 10-27 degree Celsius. In fact, there are varieties with short growing period adapted under low rainfall conditions. The row planting technique applies commonly on red clay soils having high water holding capacity. The technique potentially applies on slopes ranging from 0-10% with low stone cover. \nTeff row planting using manual seed application or hand metering technique can easily be practiced by households having large family labor. Farm households who used the manual seed drill of drum type should have the capacity to afford the seed drill and able to buy fertilizer. Teff is produced for food and market. It has a good price for sale.\nAlthough teff has high market price in country as well as an emerging export market potential, it is produced annually by subsistence farmers. The land holding is small to meet their family food demands. Their wealth condition ranges poor to average characterized with low agricultural advisory, market and water supply services and inadequate infrastructures. Energy supply is relied on biomass energy. Rural education and health services are improved. Rural unemployment and landless populations are at high rates. In general, the well being of the rural people is under poor condition.COMMENTS:Boundary points of the Technology area: 10.630850,  37.506877; 11.274962, 37.226641;  11.355705, 37.426134;  11.649907, 37.500604Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Major land use problems are soil erosion by water, soil nutrient depletion, gully erosion, steep slope cultivation, land fragmentation, and inappropriate runoff drainage practices like drainage ditches on cultivated fields.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Land users commonly specify soil erosion by water, shallow soil depth or soil depletion, low productivity of the soil, scarcity of water, and shortage of grazing land or pasture.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Production|crop production|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 908, 909, 910, 914, 916, 921, 912","readiness_level":"7.

These garden beds, which were created with local resources, are highly fertile and enable the production of much higher yields than traditional techniques, while diminishing soil erosion.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Karl Harald BierOne of the major problems in the mountainous rural zones of the municipality of L\u00e9og\u00e2ne in Haiti is the severe degradation and erosion of soils. The soil loss aggravates the vulnerable situation of the local population, mainly farmers. The Terra Preta raised garden beds were introduced in this region after the earthquake of 2010, and were replicated by several organisations and also by members of the communities. They are based on two main techniques:\n1) Terra Preta is a technique to create soils based on a lacto-acidic fermentation of organic matter with charcoal powder. This technique was used by indigenous people in Amazonia, and rediscovered and replicated recently by scientists. The technique is characterised by the use of local resources and a high fertility. With this technique, a soil layer of several decimeters can be produced in a few years, whereas this takes normally around 100 years per centimeter. Soil analyses show that the formation of humic acids can be demonstrated after 4 months.\n2) Raised garden beds (Hugelculture) are a technique from permaculture. Permaculture is a science of agricultural and social systems which uses the principles of ecology and the knowledge of traditional societies to simulate the diversity, stability and the resilience of natural ecosystems. Raised garden beds consist of an interior of ligneous material, covered by a layer of earth. The elevated construction facilitates the work in the garden and the decomposition of wood inside the beds. Due to their spongy structure, the raised garden beds function as a water reservoir during dry periods.\nThe garden beds are placed perpendicularly to the slope direction as much as possible, and are arranged alternately, with an extension to redirect the surface runoff towards the structures. This arrangement prevents the water from draining directly. This promotes the infiltration of water into the soil, where it is captured by the ligneous material, which prevents erosion (see the photograph).\nThe following inputs to the garden beds can be found locally:\n- Organic matter: ligneous material, dry straw, fresh straw, harvest residues, organic residues rich in NPK (kitchen waste, animal waste, etc.),\n- Charcoal powder (biochar),\n- Possibly ashes or other fertile materials.\nWith these materials, which are generally without cost and locally available, a raised garden bed can be set up in less than an hour. Even without additional fertilisation after the set up, the technique offers the possibility to have several cycles of vegetable production. Experiments showed good results during 4 years of continuous plantation in Thozin (Grand Go\u00e2ve). In order to secure soil fertility for many years, organic matter can be added after the period of plantation. It can be easily incorporated below the first layer of soil, and the decomposition takes place automatically. When put in place on sloping terrain, the garden beds slow down erosion strongly, and can serve to protect houses.\nThe technique is valued because of its cost-effectiveness and its sustainability compared to known techniques. The complexity of the implementation can be a limiting factor for an autonomous replication by the beneficiaries. That is when they see the set-up of the structures and think they know how to replicate it without taking account of all the details which are essential for the good functioning of the structures. This is why generally a certain level of support by technicians is required.COMMENTS:Main crops (cash and food crops): Vegetables (for example pepper, cabbage, spinach, tomato, chili pepper)\nWith this technique, marginal land can be cultivated. The soil in place does not play a very important role because the nutrients are contained in the inputs.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation|Low-cost farming tools and techniques","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1076, 1088, 1089","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Production|crop production|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 922, 897, 898, 918, 919, 917, 920","readiness_level":"7.

This technology is promoted as the existing terraces are generally narrow and this limits efficient operation and utilization of land and other resources.\nThe consolidation of narrow terraces is recommended if the general slope of the proposed site is less than 20\u00b0 (36%) with good soil drainage and low risk of land degradation. While consolidating narrow terraces, it is strongly recommended to remove the topsoil from the terraces and put it back once the levelling is completed. The consolidated terrace should maintain a maximum riser height of 1.5 m and bed width of 3.5 m. For slopes below 12\u00b0 (21%), the bench width should not exceed 5\u20136 m.\nFarmers can expand the amount of arable land available, maximize agricultural operations, and encourage sustainable farming methods for higher crop output and enhanced ecological resilience by converting narrower and more steep bench terraces into bigger ones (NSSC, 2020). A large portion of hillside farmers around the world rely on terracing. For the purpose of facilitating the growth of field crops, horticultural crops, fodder, and other crops that require specific management practices (e.g., irrigation), alone or in agroforestry systems, hilly or mountainous terrains are divided into narrow but graduated steps, typically 2-3 m wide and 50-80 m long across the slopes (Chapagain \u0026amp; Raizada, 2017).\nEnlargement of terraces begins with a thorough survey and analysis of the topography and terrain. In order to build larger terraces with the least amount of environmental damage, this phase is essential. The next step in the construction process is to reshape the present, small terraces into larger, more open ones. To make wider terraced levels, this may entail moving soil and cutting through slopes. Furthermore, filling up the gaps and levelling the land\u0027s surface is required in order to reduce the number of risers and produce a continuous, gently sloping terrace. The installation of suitable drainage systems is also crucial to guarantee adequate water management and stop soil erosion.\nLarger terraces enhance water management capabilities. With a more extensive surface area, water runoff is minimized, and the distribution of irrigation water becomes more even, promoting better soil moisture retention and reducing erosion. This, in turn, contributes to soil health and fertility, supporting sustainable farming practices. Moreover, the consolidation of smaller terraces into larger ones reduces the overall number of risers, thereby enhancing accessibility for farmworkers and farm machinery. This ease of access further optimizes the use of resources and fosters better crop management. Additionally, larger terraces can enable the implementation of crop diversification strategies, such as intercropping and crop rotation, promoting biodiversity and mitigating the risk of crop failure due to pests or adverse weather conditions.\nHowever, the process of enlarging terraces involves altering the terrain, which can lead to soil erosion, habitat destruction, and ecological imbalances. This environmental impact may negatively affect local flora and fauna, reducing biodiversity and disrupting the delicate ecological equilibrium (Deng et al., 2021). Planning for safe discharge of excess water out of the terrace system effectively helps preserve soil fertility and reduces runoff. It is essential also to pay close attention to the preservation of the local ecosystem and biodiversity throughout the process.COMMENTS:Total area is 6 hectaresSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 917, 921, 920, 918, 909","readiness_level":"6.

Below the terraced field, a cut-off drain diverts excessive rain and irrigation water to an existing gully. The terrace and the cut off drain are stabilised by an aligned tree barrier (poplar trees planted in 0.5 metre intervals), and by two parallel grass strips of 1-2 metres in width.\nThe terrace was built using a bulldozer. Digging the cut-off drain and planting the poplar cuttings was done by hand. For the initial establishment of the grass strip clods were transferred from a neighbouring pasture. The poplar trees are pruned in early spring; the cut off-drain needs to be cleared of washed in soil after heavy storm events. The described terrace is established on steep cropland prone to soil erosion. The technology is relatively simple to implement.\nPurpose of the Technology: The terrace was established to reduce soil erosion and subsequent fertility decline through the reduction of the slope angle. The tree barrier is planted because of the usefulness of poplar trees for construction purposes and to mark field boundaries; its capability of acting as a stabilising terrace is a very useful extra side effect.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Establishment costs and the rather low maintenance costs are offset by the benefits of the harvested wood produced. Poplar trees can be gradually felled and used for construction purposes 15 years after they are initially planted. Through reduction of the slope angle, the risk of soil erosion is lowered significantly. However, poplar trees can only be planted on land where sufficient water for irrigation is available, since they need to be watered on a weekly basis during the summer. Furthermore, the technology covers land which then cannot be used for cultivation of food crops.COMMENTS:\u041e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u044c, \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f, 0,5 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): severe water erosion (rills and gullies) and subsequent fertility decline on cropland and overgrazed pastures\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): soil erosion and fertility decline\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: If land is irrigated, then after the wheat harvest there can be immediate cultivation of vegetablesSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|climate change adaptation|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 910, 914, 918, 917, 920","readiness_level":"7.

The Chokar watershed is a mountainous area situated between 600 - 2,500 m above sea level. The climate is semi-arid with harsh and cold weather in winter and hot and dry summers. The annual precipitation in average years is 580mm.  Land degradation affects all forms of land use and includes low vegetation cover, heavy top soil erosion from water, and poor soil fertility.  Unsustainable agricultural practices, over-exploitation and high pressure on the natural resources are adversely impacting on the socio-economic well-being of local communities as well as contributing to  the risk for being adversely affected by drought as well as landslides and flash floods triggered by heavy rainfall.\nThe data used for the documentation of the technology is based on field research conducted in Chokar watershed, namely in the villages: Sari Joy, Jawaz Khana and Dashti Mirzai. These villages represent the upper, the middle and the lower zone of Chokar watershed, respectively.  They differ considerably in access to services and infrastructure, but in general are poorly served. The communities depend mainly on land resources for sustaining their livelihoods. In a good year with high yields, wheat-self-sufficiency lasts about 5 months.\nSince 2012 the Livelihood Improvement Project Takhar (LIPT) implemented by Terre des hommes (Tdh) Switzerland has initiated a range of NRM interventions. The project introduced terraces as sustainable land management practices on private plots, situated on rolling (11-15%) and hilly (16-30%) slopes to protect the land from soil erosion and prevent the loss of water and fertile topsoil, seeds and fertilizers.  The average plot size for terrace implementation  is 2 Jerib (0.4 hectares) with contour strips of 40m x 4m. The height of the risers is 1m-1,5 m. Terrace benches are built along the contour by moving the soil above  the bench downwards. The leveled benches of the terrace are cultivated with wheat.  The risers of the terrace are mostly used for growing fodder crops, mostly alfalfa, which also helps to stabilize the terrace.  If medicinal herbs (ferula) are included they are cultivated along the bench contours .\nMaintenance activities include small repair work on the riser by adding some amount of soil and re-sowing of alfalfa seeds on those spots.\nThe terraces allow application of improved seeds and fertilizers without them being washed off.  The land-users report noticeable increase of wheat yield from the terraced plot with application of improved seeds and fertilizer compared to the non-terraced plot. An average plot of 0.2 ha on non-terraced hilly cropland used to give about 70 kg of wheat (350kg\/ha). On terraces the yield has increased\/ doubled to 140 kg on the same plot area (700kg\/ha).  The expectations regarding terraces remain high as over the time the land user hope their land will become more stable and improved soil moisture and fertility will have positive impact on the productivity as well. However, so far no cost-benefit assessment has been conducted allowing attribution of individual measure to the wheat increase.\nMany land users are interested in the terrace technology due to a number of environmental and economic benefits expected, however the costs for building the terrace are considered  high by an average local land user. They have to rely on external support in order to have sufficient resources for implementation. Women considered an advantage that during the establishment phase, men were paid by the project to work on their own land (or other villagers land) when building the terraces. Thus, there was no need for men to go for seasonal labour migration and they stayed at home.COMMENTS:This documentation is based on the experiences of SLM impementers from Sari Joy (8 terraced plots), Jawaz Khana, (7 terraced plots), and Dashti Mirzai (11 terraced plots) as compiled during FGDs.

Additionally insights were gained through interviews in all three villages on farmers experiences and observations of terraced plots, with both  SLM implementers (46) and observers (28).SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Social contracts","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1206, 1076, 1137","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|field management|disaster management|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 908, 916, 921, 918, 909, 910, 914, 1154, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

Community laborers, trained by HELVETAS technical staff, constructed the terraces under supervision of watershed committee members. 600 terraces, each measuring 10 m x 3.6 m were constructed on seven hectares of land. To ensure maintenance, HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation facilitated the creation of community saving systems and invested 10% of the project budget for maintenance of each watershed. It improved the capacity of watershed members, so after ending project support the community watershed committee would be able to manage maintenance of watershed measures.\u2028\nNatural \/ human environment: Bamyan province is a remote province of Afghanistan with a high poverty rate. It has a semi-arid climate with cold winters and hot and dry summers. During winter, temperatures can drop below -22 degrees. Summer temperatures can reach 34 degrees in the month of July. The average annual rainfall in the area is about 230mm and some years can be very dry. 90% of the population relies on subsistence agriculture for their livelihoods and off-farm activities are marginal. The soil texture is clay, sandy loam and clay loam with moderate type of soil fertility, naked area of upper catchments causes that most of Saighan villages face to water scarcity during May to September and can\u2019t grow valuable crops.The growing season in Saighan district is relatively short from April to October and farmers can produce only one crop per year. Farmers with access to irrigation water cultivate cash crops, for example potato and vegetables, in addition to staple crops (wheat) and fodder crops.Those without access to irrigation water cultivate wheat and fodder crops only. Water scarcity during May to September may result in a lack of high value crops.\nThe average annual income from one hectare in the area of having enough irrigation water is 250000 AFN (3676 USD) and in the area which has no enough irrigation water is 67500 AFN (992 USD).COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Harvest of shrubs and over grazing for over 20 years resulted in the lost vegetation cover.

This technology is widespread in many arable lands along the narrow valley in Vanch district and very well adaptable to local conditions mainly thanks to irrigation. According to local people, it is quite an ancient technology and existed for more than 200 years. 1980-90s these land areas belonged to sovkhoz and in the wide inter-rows of walnut orchards people used to grow tobacco, which was the highly paid crop. Today people plant there necessary crops, and so, this old technology returned. These gardens are gorgeous and become a symbolic place of the region.  Normally, walnut does not grow in this area as the amount of the precipitation in there is not enough.\nPurpose of the Technology: Rational use of small areas of the most fertile irrigated land in the narrow mountainous valley in order to guarantee self-sufficiency of households with diverse products. (i.e. receiving diverse crops from the same place).\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Judging by the way young orchards were planted on the natural moraine terraces on the slopes people there are trying to introduce exactly this technology. First, different types of fruit trees are planted 5-6 meters far from each other, but walnut trees are planted very far from each other. Life of fruit trees do not last as long as walnut trees, and therefore, fruit trees are later uprooted leaving the long-living walnut in that plot. This is, probably, the reason why the distance between walnut trees are so big.\nInitial measures: territory is cleaned from stones, which are used for fencing to protect the area from animals; digging up main irrigation channel, and from it, smaller channels reaching all parts of the garden along which different fruit trees and walnut are planted; between the rows cereals, beans and perennial forage are planted.\nNatural \/ human environment: The garden is located in Udob village, Teharv jamoat. Heigh - 2115\u043c. The area of arable plot is not big. Farming is impossible without irrigation because of the low rainfall.\nAlthough walnut wood is valued as a good construction material, here people prefer to have walnuts. Vanch walnuts are famous for it taste and high yield. In cases, when a big walnut tree falls down, it can be profitably sold to local masters, who make a big wooden plates and spoons, which are widely used in the households and famous as a souvenirs.  Even through at the beginning a household is able to receive only beans, potatoes, grains, fodder and do not receive any yield from fruit trees for 8-10 years (walnut trees give yield even later), many farmers still use this technology. This region is famous with its fruits (apples, mulberries etc.) and with high quality walnuts.COMMENTS:technology is widely spread on the plains, but there is also potential for its further spreading on the moraine terraces on the slopesMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): lack of land suitable for agriculture because of the several reasons: the large part of the region occupied by the mountain ranges with steep slopes; it has arid climate with very little rainfall; agriculture is impossible without irrigation; very stony soil.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): lack of irrigation water and land area\nNomadism: Yes\nForest products and services: timber, fuelwood, grazing \/ browsing, nature conservation \/ protection\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: These are all separate annual crops.

Acidity is a problem in soil caused by iron sulphate that becomes sulfuric acid (H2SO4) upon oxidizing when exposed to the air. Therefore, it requires agricultural lime that are hydroxide, oxide compounds or carbonate with calcium or magnesium as the main component to neutralize or partly reduce the acidity. Agricultural lime is available mainly in the forms of slaked lime, marl, or ground limestone.\nAcid sulfate soils are formed from the sediments of seawater or brackish water containing pyrite that changes to sulfuric acid upon oxidizing and accumulate in the soil. Acid sulfate soils are highly acidic, with low fertility. They are severely de\ufb01cient in nutrients essential for plant growth such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Moreover, there are certain elements that are harmful to the plant growth such as iron, aluminium, manganese. Acid sulfate soils in Thailand occur along the East Coast, the West Coast and in the east part of the southern peninsula. Land Development Department reported that 35% of areas with acid sulfate soils are medium to severely acidic, limiting rice yields to between 625 and 1,560 kg\/ha.  When the Land Development Department started in 1963, it put the Acid Sulfate Soils Improvement as one of its prominent programs - and work still goes on up to now. The general practice has been to furnish farmers in the affected area with 1 ton of marl (CaCO3 deposit, excavated from the marl pit in Saraburi Province) per rai ( 6.25 rai = one ha). The objectives of using this technology are to (1) improve soils of acid property as soils are the basic resource for plant production, and (2) to increase the production of rice. Before applying marl, the land should be well levelled so that marl can react with acid soil e\ufb03ciently. Tractors can enter and drop marl sacks over the paddy area, which is then spread  by hand. The rate of marl to apply is around 6-12 tons\/ha, depending on the soil pH.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Chemicals|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 2073, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|field management|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 910, 1180, 914, 909","readiness_level":"9.

It involves clearing the ground to create basin-like structures, which are a few meters in diameter and bordered by ridges. This technique is essentially used to (i) cultivate encrusted land, (ii) reduce runoff, (iii) concentrate rainwater at the foot of trees by improving its infiltration into the soil, (iv) induce early flowering of fruit trees, (v) improve fruit tree production and (vi) restore biological diversity to agroecosystems.\nThe protocol for installing the technique is as follows :\n-Use a compass with a 2-meter radius to pivot and create the half-moon shape;\n-Use a pick, pickaxe, and shovel to dig the half-moon to a depth of 15 to 20 cm;\n-Build the ridges starting from the inside and working outward. The height of the ridges can vary, depending on the slope severity, but can reach up to 40 cm;\n-Arrange the half-moons in a staggered pattern perpendicular to the slope or following the contour lines; and\n-Maintain a 4-metre spacing between two rows of half-moons.\nIt is recommended to enrich the half-moons with organic fertilizer or well-decomposed compost. Depending on availability, up to 35 kg of compost or manure, or a wheelbarrow full, could be added to each half-moon. Once the half-moon has been installed, it is recommended that it be systematically mulched to minimize moisture loss.\nThe half-moon technique can be implemented at any time of the year, but preferably in February-March or August-September on orange and cashew trees, to maintain structures designed to collect runoff water. To ensure the longevity of the technique, it is advisable to reshape larger ridges whenever their size diminishes, to strengthen the barrier.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1206, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 921, 917, 920, 918","readiness_level":"9.

The most important concept underlying the new theory of farming is efficient allocation of land to serve the different needs of farm households. This includes paddy fields, farm ponds for water and fish, and cash crops, fruit trees, and trees for farm income, plus a residential area. It\u0027s goal is solving the problem of shortage of land and water resources, which is a very serious problem in Thailand, in order to help smallholder farmers make a living. Apart from the fact that the size of the farm and water resources are the limiting factors in this area, the land is also degraded by both natural and human activities. The area is classified as sand dunes with low to very low soil fertility where farmers mostly grow the same crops continuously. This results in high risk of  fluctuations in the amount of production - and insufficient food crop production for household consumption. Therefore, land allocation for agriculture under the concept of the new theory of agriculture is the appropriate use of resources in small-scale areas for optimal benefits and increases in household incomes. Nowadays, farmers in adjacent areas are realizing the benefits obtained from land allocation, and they have formed a group to improve the use of their small-scale holdings for optimal benefits. \nThe new agricultural theory was initiated by His Majesty the Late King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand to provide help for farmers with small-scale farms. For land allocation, the land is divided into 4 parts. Part 1 is designated for a pond to store rainwater during the rainy season and to supply water to grow crops in the dry season as well as for raising aquatic animals (fish, field crabs) and plants (such as morning glory, water mimosa, etc.). Part 2 is set aside for rice cultivation during the rainy season as the daily staple in households throughout the year, which cuts down on expenses and allows the farmers to be self-reliant. Part 3 is used for growing fruit trees, perennials, vegetables, and field crops for daily consumption. If there is any surplus from consumption, it can be sold. Part 4 is used for dwellings, animal husbandry, roads and other structures  - including barns, strawstacks, compost, houses, mushroom nurseries, stalls, flowering-plants, ornamental plants, home-grown vegetables in backyard gardens. The proportion of the area in each section can be adjusted for either increase or decrease depending on the conditions of each location and the necessity of farmers who make use of the area, but it is usually 30:30:30:10.COMMENTS:Crops include rice, vegetable, limes, tropical fruits, and trees, while aquatic animals include a variety of fishes and crabs.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1197, 1206, 1076","use_cases":"Production|crop production|fisheries products management|Farm management|income increase|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 900, 910, 1180, 915, 916, 920, 921, 914, 912","readiness_level":"7.

This method is primarily improved irrigation water use efficiency, reduced water erosion and more importantly lowers the expenses on irrigation water by 30%.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Abdybek AsanalievThe ridge sowing technology is applied in CIS countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan.) in the production of wheat and other cereals. Kyrgyzstan first applied this technology with the support of the SIDA project \u201cSupport to seed development industry in Kyrgyzstan\u201d. Further dissemination of this method was supported by the Seed Growers\u2019 Association of Kyrgyzstan.  This technology was utilized in Kyrgyzstan through the use of the Turkish seeder \u0421BP-2,8, which forms ridges, sows and simultaneously cuts furrows to irrigate between the ridges.  The ridge sowing technology creates optimal conditions for agricultural crops and provides effective furrow irrigation. This prevents excessive use of irrigation water (saving 25-30%) and irrigation erosion, which happens in the case of using flooding methods on the crop fields using common corn planters. In addition, it prevents the flooding of useful soil micro fauna, as well as saves time. Prior to irrigation or after irrigation, a tractor or agricultural machine can easily go along the irrigation furrows to spray plants with herbicides and pesticides.  Ridge sowing of cereals can be implemented almost on all types of grey-brownish, grey, red, yellow soil types with middle and light mechanical composition. In addition to cereals, ridge sowing can be used for growing vegetables and legumes (including potato), as well as industrial and oil crops (sugar beet, rape, soya bean, sesame)\nDepending on natural climatic conditions and biological peculiarities of the cultivated varieties, width between the ridges is about 60-70cm. 2-3 rows of seeds can be sown on the ridges with a row spacing of 15cm. Over the course of 3 years, 10 ha of land were sown by using this technology, and the wheat grain yield was not reduced in comparison to the conventional cultivation method using a corn planter.  While sowing cereals with such a seeder, it is recommended to cultivate well-bushing varieties. The ridge seeder decreases the seeding rate to a minimum.  The seeding rate of cereals is 100-150kg\/ha instead of 200-250kg\/ha when using the usual sowing method with a classical corn planter and provides additional yield  of winter grain wheat up to   5 -8,3 centner\/ha. Practice is documented in the frame of CACILM.\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of this technology is to decrease irrigation erosion and to improve soil moisture content through the use of effective irrigation techniques utilizing irrigation furrows.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The main cost linked to the introduction of ridge sowing is the purchase of the ridge seeder.  The establishment costs of ridge sowing are similar to the ones for conventional sowing methods using corn planters, but in the long term the maintenance costs will be far lower.

About 40\u0027000 people were compulsorily relocated. The construction of the reservoir lead to a shortage of fish, making aquaculture a viavle and profitable alternative. However excess feed and excreta of fish add nutrients and pollute water.\nThe \u201cGreen Liver System\u201d uses aquatic plants, established in artificial wetlands, to remove, transfer, stabilize or eliminate pollutants in wastewater from fish farms. The use of large quantities of feed in aquaculture, along with the application of antibiotics, hormones and probiotics, has negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems due to the introduction of nitrogen, phosphorous and drug residues into the system. The Green Liver System is a form of phytoremediation (phyto = plant and remediate = correct) that uses a range of plants to decompose, extract, or hold contaminants present in soils and waters. This technology has been considered as an innovative alternative and a low cost option compared to others used in contaminated sites - like membrane bioreactors, upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), and others.\nThe plants selected for use in Green Liver System artificial wetlands depend on the pollutant to be removed. Research shows physiological differences between species, which need to be taken into account when planning wastewater treatments. Ideal plants for phytoremediation need: a) a fast growth rate; b) high biomass production; c) long rooting systems; d) easy maintenance\/pruning; e) to be able to persists, and f) to have the ability to store trace metals within specific parts which can be later removed.\nThe Green Liver System uses aquatic macrophytes, which extract contaminants from the water, store them, or even metabolize them - transforming them into less toxic or harmless products. In the case of Eichhornia crassipes, most of the solids in suspension are removed by sedimentation or by adsorption in the root system. The dense coverage of these plants reduces the mixing effect of the wind, as well as minimizing thermal mixture. Shading by the plants restricts algal growth and the root system prevents horizontal movement of particulate material. In this way, particles are removed from the wastewater and microorganisms associated with the plants\u2019 rhizosphere slowly decompose. Many organisms can be used in biodegradation: these include bacteria and fungi as well as plants, and the efficiency of one or the other depend, in many cases, on the molecule structure and of the presence of enzymes that are effective in degrading the pollutant.\nThe fish farm used as an example here is located on the margins of the Itaparica reservoir in Brazil. There are dozens of excavated tanks used to produce tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and \u201ctambaqui\u201d (Colossoma macropomum) fingerlings and juvenile fish. As well as these tanks, there are many net enclosures installed in the reservoir where the fishes are reared to maturity. Part of the wastewater from the excavated tanks is released into a stabilization lagoon, and the remainder goes to the Green Liver System. The effluent is enriched with spare feed, and excreta from the fish, which includes drug residues. If not treated, this may cause eutrophication because of its mineral richness. The Green Liver System consists of an excavated tank of 100m x 20m x 2m in size. The tank is subdivided into six parts: two planted to Eichhornia crassipes and four to Egeria densa. A mesh barrier stops fish from being flushed into the tank. Regular monitoring of the physical, chemical and biological parameters is required to control environmental fluctuations.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 2 km2.\nThe reservoir is 100m long and 20 m wide, with a depth of 1.7 m, but the area may be larger depending on the volume of effluent to be treated. The whole area comprises the fish ponds.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The Itaparica reservoir was completed in 1988 to generate hydropower. About 40,000 people were compulsorily relocated. The construction of the reservoir had interrupted fish movement, leading to a shortage of fish, making aquaculture a viable and profitable alternative, and current law allows this. However excess feed and excreta of fish, partly containing drug residues, add nutrients and pollute water. ECONOMIC ASPECTS: The agricultural economy of this semi-arid region is characterized by pastoral activities, as well as the cultivation of crop species resistant to drought, such as cotton, corn (maize), beans, and cassava in humid areas. Irrigation from the reservoir was potentially possible but investments in aquaculture proved more profitable. In general, the commercial companies involved do not treat effluent, leading to pollution. Even though monitoring is mandatory, almost nobody does it, nor do they make substantial efforts to purify the effluent.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): There are several conflicts over water and related land use in the region. Some people say the water quality in the reservoir is good (and use it directly for drinking), others report ill-health especially during times of low water levels. Commercial aquaculture primarily produces tilapia. Invariably, some tilapia escape from their net cages and take over from other local species. The hydroelectric company manages the reservoir according to national needs in electricity \u2013 thus sudden water level fluctuations are frequent. Commercial aquaculture and associated land use dominate the shoreline, preventing access for artisanal fishermen to their traditional fishing grounds.\nFuture (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Other: Ow: Waterways, drainage lines, ponds, dams\nConstraints of transition land, fallow or sporadicall used by roaming livestock (mainly goats) (area in between the land-based aquaculture and the lake)\nNumber of growing seasons per year: 1\nLongest growing period from month to month: all year due to tropical climateSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Bioremediation and phytoremediation|Nature-based solutions|Constructed wetlands","type_id":"993, 994, 1000, 1196, 1208","use_cases":"Production|fisheries products management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact|animal production","use_cases_id":"897, 900, 916, 920, 917, 925, 899","readiness_level":"7.

In this mountain regions  wood and biomass are usually limited because of the harsh climate, risky agricultural zone and limited arable land. In the first decade of the transition period after the collapse of the Soviet Union problems with electricity and therfore the demand for fuel and wood increased. This caused a lot of forest degradation, because people were cutting trees from government owned and community areas for their fuel needs and used animal manure for heating their houses and cooking food. The technology is specifically designed to use low cost materials so that rural households can afford it. The technology consists of material like foil and wood to build frames for some layers to keep in the heat. Depending on the altitude, which is linked to the climate condition, the number of layers is increased where the climate is cold. The layer in between contains air, which prevents outside and inside air to move out\/in. The technology was intended for saving up to 30% fuel. The technology includes support of entrepreneurs to make foil available in the market and provides training for local masters and labourers in designing and constructing of the technology.  The main benefit is to contribute to biomass savings and forest preservation through reduced use of wood for heating and cooking. Land users are in favour because through this technology they are using less wood and save forest. They also burn less manure and can use it as fertilizers for their land. The technology brings comfort for longer periods of time by keeping heat inside the room. In addition it contribute also to hygine and sanitation, as less fire making prevents smoke emission and therefore keeps the rooms clean. On first sight the technology seems expensive, becasue of the material costs but in the long run when the cost effectiveness is explained land users accepted it.COMMENTS:The technology is applied in buildings but have direct effect on preserving woodlands and crop lands.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Manufacturing technologies|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1009, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change mitigation|forestry management|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact|improving soil management practices","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 919, 927, 925, 921","readiness_level":"7.

The Tiarako dyke consists of an assembly of medium-sized loose stones with a horizontal crest approximately 50 cm high and 50 cm wide. It serves to mitigate water runoff from slopes and protect other structures. Alternatively, it can be placed along runoff lines as intermediate structures, effectively controlling stronger flows.\nThe Tiarako bund is built in five stages:\n1) Identifying the major slope:\nWith a simple observation of the land with the naked eye the farmer can determine which way the water flows fastest during the rainy season; this is the major slope. This observation can be improved by using a watertube level or an A-Frame.\n2) Determining the contour lines using a watertube level :\n\u2022position oneself at one end upstream of the site to be surveyed, perpendicular to the slope;\n\u2022Position support 1 at the end of the projected bund. Support 2 is adjusted iteratively until the water level aligns with the reference point of Support 1, marking the crossing of the contour line.\n\u2022Once this point is determined, mark a line on the ground connecting the bases of the two supports, or replace the supports with stakes.\n\u2022Secure Support 2 in place and adjust Support 1 in the desired direction. Repeat the iterative process to locate the marker, then trace as previously instructed. Continue this process until reaching the end of the treatment area\n3) Smoothing\nThis involves delineating the contour lines while smoothening the curve\u0027s contours.

In recent years, farmers found that this pest was becoming prevalent and that they could not control it permanently using either cheap or eco-friendly solutions. Researchers and development officers took up the challenge and found that grafting technology could successfully control not only the root knot nematode but also wilting disease. As a bonus, they also found that grafting can increase the yield potential of the plants and improve the overall productivity of the land.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Loam and silt loam soils with a pH of 6.0\u20137.0 are the most suitable for this type of cultivation. Grafting technology requires two plants: the scion and the rootstock. The scion is a detached shoot or twig containing buds from the desired woody plant. The rootstock is a plant with an established healthy root system, onto which a cutting or a bud from another plant is grafted. The scion seedlings are grown in raised solarized nursery beds, where care has been taken to see that the soil has been sterilised and all soil pests have been destroyed. Robust rootstock of wild eggplant (Solanum sysimbrifolium) is appropriate for tomato propagation. The rootstock seedlings are grown in multi cell trays and transplanted when they are 20\u201325 cm high and have a few leaves and a pencil thick stalk. Seeds for the rootstock seedlings are sown in March\/April and are ready in 6\u20138 weeks; scion seeds are sown in April\/May and are ready for grafting in 3\u20134 weeks. Both scion and rootstock plants should have achieved similar stalk thicknesses at the time of grafting. Cleft grafting is carried out and the grafted seedlings kept in polypots in a closed polyhouse for 7\u201310 days. Then the grafted seedlings are carefully transplanted to their permanent location. The grafted plants are watered the day after they are transplanted; the extent of watering depends on how moist the soil is and on local weather conditions.

The majority of such terraces in Nepal were constructed by hand many generations ago, but some new land - mostly already under rainfed cultivation on forward sloping terraces - is still being converted into irrigated terraces. The initial costs for the construction of the terraces are extremely high \u2013 and annual maintenance costs are considerable also. The climate is humid subtropical, slopes are steep (30%-60%) and soils generally have a sandy loam texture.  Terraces are cropped by farmers who mostly have less than 0.5 ha of land each.\nTwo to three annual crops are grown per year starting with paddy rice during the monsoon, followed by potatoes and\/or wheat.\nWhile terrace beds are usually 2\u20136 m in width, to save labour they are made as wide as they can be without increasing the danger of slips\/land slides. Surveying was traditionally done by eye, but now a water-tube level may be used. Risers are 0.8-1.5 m high with a small lip (20-25 cm). The slope of the riser varies from 80 to 160%, depending on the initial gradient of the hill. Stones are incorporated in the risers if available, and grass species such as bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) and napier (Pennisetum purpureum) may be planted for stabilisation and as cattle fodder. The risers are compacted (with hoes) to improve ponding conditions for the paddy rice. Twice per year the risers are scraped with a special tool: (1) at the time of land preparation for paddy rice the lower part of riser is sliced, but the upper part is left protected with grasses against the monsoon rains; (2) at the time of wheat planting the whole riser (including the lip) is scraped and spread as green manure on the terrace.\nTerraces are flooded with water for paddy rice cultivation: a smaller amount of water is diverted into the fields for other crops. Excess water is drained to the lower terrace by openings in the lip, which are filled with rice straw in order to filter out sediments.

In this system the plant nutrients, which are gradually released in the soil, added from the atmosphere or from dust or silt deposition, accumulates in the fallow vegetation and in the soil during the fallow period. It is then utilized over a shorter period of time than the period of accumulation. In this rain-fed cultivation system an area is cleared off from natural vegetation by slash-and-burn, cropped for one or two years and then allowed to revert to natural vegetation. After some years, the area may be cleared and cropped again in the similar manner, but not necessarily within the same boundaries, nor by the same farmers. \nThis is a mixed cropping system of the ethnic people of CHT for their sustainable food supply . In Jhum system sowing and weeding are done without major topsoil disturbance using simple tools. Jhumias grow mixed crops like upland paddy, maize, sesame, flower, chilli , sour leaf, cucurbits, beans, turmeric, ginger, cotton, etc together but harvest the crops in succession. This cultivation system is not environment friendly as it declines soil fertility, acclerates soil erosion, and reduces biodiversity.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.04 km2.\nShifting cultivation is the common practice of the tribal people and covers about 2.5% area of CHT region.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Due to scarcity of land for judicial paddy production, the tribals have resorted to use marginal areas of CHT for Jhum.  Unlike the past, the fallow period has reduced to 3-5 years from 15-20 years which has led to decline in the soil fertility, acclerated erosion, and diminishing trend of biodiversity.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Scarcity of plain land for paddy cultivation \u0026amp; no other alternatives for income generation.

Farmyard manure is a mixture of livestock excreta, bedding materials, and other organic wastes accumulated in the farmyard. It is typically left to decompose, or it is composted, before being applied to agricultural fields.\nFYM application enhances soil fertility by replenishing essential plant nutrients, improving soil structure and moisture retention, increasing microbial activity, and promoting overall soil health. The organic matter in FYM serves as a nutrient source for plants, while also enhancing the soil\u0027s ability to retain water and nutrients, reducing erosion, and promoting beneficial microbial activity (Hossain et al., 2021).\nBhutan, a landlocked country nestled in the eastern Himalayas, has a predominantly agrarian economy. Farming practices in Bhutan often involve smallholder farmers who rely on traditional methods of soil fertility management, including the application of farmyard manure. According to Dorji et al., (2018) traditional soil fertility management through FYM application is very common in Bhutan. The use of FYM helps support sustainable agricultural production in the country.\nSoil fertility management through FYM application in Bhutan, is conducted as follows. First and foremost, the collection of farmyard manure is essential, which involves the accumulation of livestock excreta, bedding materials, and organic waste in the farmyard. Then the collected material needs to be properly managed and decomposed through composting to ensure the production of high-quality farmyard manure. Adequate storage facilities for the composted manure should be established to prevent nutrient loss and maintain its quality. Additionally, farmers need to be trained and educated on the proper techniques of FYM application, including the optimal timing, rate, and method of application to maximize its effectiveness. Regular monitoring and assessment of soil fertility parameters are crucial to evaluate the impact of FYM application and make necessary adjustments to the management practices (Wangmo, 2020).\nTraditional soil fertility management through FYM application in Bhutan offers numerous benefits and positive impacts as already noted. Furthermore, the use of FYM helps to reduce the dependency on synthetic fertilizers, thereby contributing to sustainable agriculture and minimizing the risk of environmental pollution. Overall, traditional soil fertility management through FYM application supports long-term soil health, sustainable agricultural production, and environmental conservation in Bhutan (Gyeltshen, 2020).COMMENTS:Private landAnnual cropping is doneSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|climate change adaptation|minimize pesticide use","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 917, 922, 919, 918, 926","readiness_level":"9.

They are built across the slope when new land is cleared of loose stone and brought into crop cultivation. The dimensions of the terrace walls and the spacing between them depend on various factors, especially the slope and the amount of stone in the field. The walls may be up to 1.25 m high, from 1.0 to 1.5 m in base width, and between 20 and 50 m long. Spacing is from 3 to 10 m apart. Design of stone terrace walls varies. Some walls are very neatly built, others are merely piles of stone across the slope: this depends on the individual land user. The walls are built up each year with further stones: this may just be as more loose stone comes to the surface when ploughing, or also by digging out larger stones to deliberately build up the height of the walls as it silts up behind. Such terracing is generally confined to slopes between 20% and 50%. From 12% to 20% contour grass strips (thambaladza) are normally used, but below 12% land is rarely protected with structures or strips.\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of terracing, apart from simultaneously clearing the land of stone, is to guard against loss of topsoil. Together with contour ploughing this helps to keep soil fertility in place on sloping cropland in a subhumid area. Rainfall is around 1,000 mm per annum and maize is the most common crop, but various other annuals (beans, pumpkins, sorghum etc) and perennials (peaches, avocadoes, oranges etc) are also grown.\nNatural \/ human environment: This example of land conservation is probably unique in a former South African \u2018homeland\u2019. In such areas, where the black population were concentrated at high population densities under the former apartheid regime, land degradation rather than soil conservation was the rule. These terraces continue to be built to this day as new land is opened up, despite the high amounts of labour (300-500 person days per hectare) involved in establishment. A study of the conservation systems used in the area and local attitudes to them, showed that the benefits of conservation were well understood by local farmers (see reference). Those questioned identified retention of soil - and of soil fertility in particular - as being of paramount importance. No mention was made of terraces being built simply to remove surface stone. The only downside mentioned (by a few) was the loss of cultivable land area. The key to the persistence of the terraces in this area is, therefore, that the land users understand and appreciate the place of terraces in maintaining soil fertility, and their considerable contribution to crop production.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 8 km2.\nWithin the Northern region of South Africa\u0027s Northern Province (formerly \u0022Venda\u0022) a few areas are apparently covered with ancient stone terraces - but Thononda Ward of Thohoyandou district is the best example and the only oneMajor cash crop: Maize and avocado\nMajor food crop: Maize\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Agreement with the land-user\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Decline in fertility of soil, erosion on roads\/from roads, yield burning leading to runoff.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 910, 914, 922, 918","readiness_level":"9.

L\u2019objectif est la stabilisation des ravines par la construction de barri\u00e8res qui r\u00e9duirsent la force des eaux de ruissellement et de provoquer des atterrissements. Ce travail requiert divers proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par la pente du terrain, la configuration et les dimensions des ravines. Si la ravine est peu d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e (0.5 m de profondeur sur 1m de largeur) avec une pente inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 20% et si elle ne charrie que des alluvions fines, des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de traitement biologique peuvent y \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es.

Les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s m\u00e9caniques consistent en la construction de seuils au travers du lit de la ravine, tels que les seuils en pierres s\u00e8ches, seuils en gabions, seuils en ma\u00e7onnerie, seuils en sacs de terre, etc. Vu du sommet, les seuils ont deux formes distinctes : Une forme rectiligne, moins solide mais plus facile \u00e0 construire et une forme curviligne avec une concavit\u00e9 offrant une meilleure r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 la force des eaux.\nCharacteristics et \u00e9l\u00e9ments:\nLa hauteur des seuils est \u00e9gale \u00e0 la profondeur du ravin, mais ne d\u00e9passe pas 1.80 m.

Il a donc une coupe trap\u00e9zo\u00efdale avec une inclinaison de l\u2019ordre de 20% en direction de la montagne.\nLes seuils comprennent aussi:\n-Un d\u00e9versoir pour bien canaliser les \u00e9coulements ;\n-Un radier et un contre seuil pour \u00e9viter les affouillements en aval du seuil.

This demonstrates the potential to increase yields and provide long-term economic and ecological stability for farmers. Experience was gained from implementation in 2008 on a monocrop coconut farm in Pollachi, Tamil Nadu. The stages were as follows:\n1) Rainwater management: Trenches were dug throughout the farm to retain rainwater and prevent runoff, thus enhancing soil moisture. This was critical given the limited rainfall in the region. A drip irrigation system was installed for efficient watering.\n2) Plant diversity:  Various crops were introduced. Nutmeg, intercropped among coconut trees, provides 3 - 4 times the income of coconuts after 15 to 20 years. Timber trees extract micronutrients from deeper soil layers via deep tap roots: micronutrients are concentrated in the leaves which are used as mulch to enrich the soil nutrient profile. Banana and papaya provided early income, shade for plants, and added biomass. This diversity also ensures a steady income, reducing dependency on external markets.\n3) Biomass and soil fertility improvement: Fast-growing crops were planted to generate additional biomass. Leaves were pruned and added to the water-retaining trenches as mulch. Nitrogen-fixing plants were cultivated extensively to improve soil fertility, eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers.\n4) Mulch and bio-input application: Mulch in the trenches was decomposed by the bio-inputs from Cows (Earlier 2, now 1) applied via drip lines, which increased soil organic matter through enhanced microbial decomposition. The irrigation and sprinklers were used judiciously to achieve soil moisture rather than over-watering, as trees primarily needed stable moisture conditions.\n5) Minimal maintenance approach:  After establishing this system, the farm required minimal maintenance. There was no need for tilling, weeding, or other intensive practices, just monitoring of, and maintaining, moisture levels. This low-maintenance approach reduces farmers\u2019 workloads and improves their quality of life.\n6) Enhanced biodiversity and pest management: To further enhance biodiversity, flowering plants to attract pollinators and predatory insects can be planted along the farm\u0027s boundaries - though this was not done at this particular site. Nonetheless, the increased biodiversity already fostered here brought in earthworms, birds, and beneficial insects for natural pest management.\nAfter 12 years of minimal maintenance, soil organic matter content increased from 0.5% to 3.36%, and both production quantity and quality increased. The farm retained high soil moisture despite periods of low rainfall. Land users liked the use of minimal inputs, crop diversification as a financial safety net, and the visible impact on soil health and yield, as well as the increase in land value. There was initial fear about time and money invested and doubts about the feasibility of a technology that challenged the status quo of the region. Digging trenches and planting saplings were physically demanding. The initial pest pressure was also a concern before a stable ecosystem was established. The transformation of this coconut monoculture into a diverse food forest has demonstrated a sustainable model of enhanced resilience, productivity, and biodiversity. This model can be replicated across similar regions to help minimize labor and improve farmers\u2019 livelihoods while restoring land and ecosystems.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Integrated management systems|Species diversification|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1203, 1197, 1200, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|income increase|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 921, 918, 920, 910, 914, 1180, 915, 909","readiness_level":"7.

Each of these villages developed 10 acres of associated common pastureland. In total, 100 acres were developed. The project offered local solutions to develop village wastelands (common term in India for degraded lands)  into ecologically regenerated  pasturelands. Village pastureland, developed in such manner was used for open and free grazing for livestock. This enhanced milk production thus  generating income for village  women and their families.\nProcess\nMARAG formed a WPLMC (Women\u2019s Pastureland Management Committee) in each village consisting of 10 members. Each WPLMC managed 10 acres of these common pasturelands in their respective villages. WPLMCs were trained and engaged in land mapping and demarcation through GPS, soil testing, land cleaning and land levelling, selection of native grass seeds, sowing of such grasses, and general maintenance and management of the land.\nThe rules and regulations for land management were determined by the WPLMCs. WPLMCs jointly decided to use 5 of 10 acres of each village gaucher (local term for pasture) to develop traditional grasses for small ruminants. Out of this, 2.5 acres were developed as fodder for large livestock and 2.5 acres were developed for drought tolerant species. Finally, the WPLMCs documented the regulation and use of pastureland and the responsibility of the management.\n The following processes were employed for pastureland regeneration:\n1.Silvipasture practice\n2.Land treatment and afforestation\n3.Reintroduction of traditional grass seeds.\n4.Tapping of indigenous pastoral knowledge for grass development and breed conservation.\n5.Forming and strengthening Women Pastureland Management Committees (WPLMC) at village level for project sustainability.\n6.Using technology and capacity building of the WPLMC (e.g. GPS tools for land measuring, mobile app use for determining land fertility and water catchment etc.)\nLivestock rearing can be a tool for the sustainable management of land, especially in arid and semiarid areas, by improving soil health, mitigating desertification and protecting the local ecosystem against invasive species. Sustanable livestock grazing  breaks soil crust, increasing rain water absorpstion and converts grass into organic waste, increasing soil health and regenarating grasses by spreading seed.\nProject Impact\n1.Developed women leadership and management capacities as well as decision making throughout the project process.\n2.Ownership of the pastureland development taken by pastoralist women.\n3.Pastoralist women learning and using the smartphone for land mapping. Such knowledge is easily copied by other women in the village.\n4.Traditional knowledge on pasture grasses women to deepen their knowledge on pasture management.\n5.Biodiversity conservation through traditional knowledge.\n6.Secured livelihood security and food sovereignty.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies|Mobile app|Geospatial technologies|GPS|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Institutional|Capacity development function","type_id":"993, 1015, 1032, 1052, 1028, 1196, 1206, 1076, 1116, 1126","use_cases":"Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|Farm management|income increase|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 1186, 899, 916, 917, 921, 918, 919, 910, 1180, 922","readiness_level":"7.

In this way, overexploitation of the aquifer is being reduced.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The pumps transfer water from canals or streams for irrigation purposes.  A pumping station (10HP), pipes (PP-R, \u00d8 1100mm) for water transport and diesel or electricity for pump operation are the major items needed to replace groundwater with freshwater irrigation. However, annual maintenance of the pump and network is necessary.\nNatural \/ human environment: The majority of families living in the research area make their living mostly from agricultural activities but also from livestock. Croplands are dominantly irrigated by wells (groundwater) and only those which are close to streams are irrigated with freshwater.  Owing to over-pumping of the aquifer in order to irrigate the crop fields, there has been seawater intrusion over the past years. As a result, irrigation with groundwater led to saline soils. The group affected by this process comprises farmers who are now beginning to understand the extent of the desertification problem in the area. The degradation process significantly affects the quality of life of the local people. Saline soils lead to low productivity and thus to lower incomes (causing poverty) and thus an increase in social unrest. Although the farmers are totally aware of the on-going degradation problem that affects their fields and their livelihoods, they seem to be unwilling to change the way they irrigate their fields (with groundwater) as long as they do not have an alternative source of irrigation such as freshwater from local streams. The lack of information about how the salt-affected fields can be restored also makes the farmers believe that this situation is permanent and will extend over a wider area.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 9.59 km2.\nAreas adjacent to freshwater surface streams.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soil salinization and sodification.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Soil salinization.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|income increase|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 920, 921, 910, 914, 1180, 915","readiness_level":"7.

They are formed into ridges across the slope to form semi permeable barriers that decrease the runoff velocity and increase the infiltration duration, but allow passage of excess runoff. They impede runoff and enhance infiltration. They also prevent evaporation of water from the soil thus conserving soil moisture. Different dimensions and spacing as practiced by farmers have given rise to different structures depending on availability of materials and tools. Thus there are large and small, fixed and mobile trash lines, spaced about 15 m apart.  The position of most trash lines is not fixed but instead new trash is placed 3 to 5m up slope each season.\nPurpose of the Technology: Trash lines allow water to infiltrate into the soil in the area directly beneath them, and require little labour to construct but frequent maintenance. Trash lines form semi-permeable barriers across the slope that decrease the surface runoff velocity and increase the infiltration duration of impounded water, but allow passage of excess runoff. As a result, the amount of infiltrated water increases and the runoff volume and its erosive power decrease. Additionally, retention of sediment in the trash results in reduced soil and nutrient losses. Trash lines require low labor.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Farmers in Embu utilizes the crop residuals after harvesting. The most common used type of crop residual used in Embu district is maize stovers that are left behind after harvesting. They are laid down in a row along the contour and left to decompose after sometime leaving a line of rich organic matter. They do very well when practiced with conservation agriculture.  This is very common in the lower Mbeere District.\nNatural \/ human environment: In other areas, cereal stover (straw) and weeds that are collected during primary cultivation (hand hoeing), and heaped in strips along the approximate contour are used as trash lines. Creeping grasses should not be used in trash lines, they can alternatively be decomposed in bundles, and then used as mulch in nearby banana plantations. Trash lines can also be constructed on hillside fields where annual crops, including sorghum, finger millet, beans and peas, are grown.The recommended spacing between the improved trash lines is 5\u201310 m, depending on the slope: the steeper the closer. The amount of material available determines the cross section of each trash line (typically \u00b10.5 m wide and \u00b10.3 m high).COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Reduction of soil erosion and excessive evaporation\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Increase of organic matter to increase nutrientsSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Production|crop production|climate change adaptation|Farm management|field management|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 920, 922, 917, 897, 898, 918, 910, 914, 925","readiness_level":"7.

In this technology, bamboo levers are pushed repeatedly by foot to provide the driving power to lift water. This simple device is relatively easy to install and maintain and is environmentally friendly. Three types of treadle pumps are in common use; all three use the cylinder and paddle concept, but the model which uses a cylinder 8.9 cm in diameter and has bamboo paddles is the one most commonly favoured by farmers in the region. It is cheaper and can lift more water than a comparable hand pump. On average, a treadle pump can be used to lift water from about 6 m underground and one such pump can irrigate as much as 0.34 ha of land (depending on the soil type and other conditions). In addition to lifting water for irrigation, the treadle pump can also be used for a variety of domestic purposes. In the Terai areas of Nepal, it is also widely used as a means of generating income.\nWhen farmers consider installing a treadle pump, they first need to verify whether there is sufficient groundwater to merit the expense. Treadle pumps should be installed by trained technicians and properly maintained throughout their lifetime. If possible, an extra set of spare parts should always be kept on hand and a trained technician should be consulted for major repairs.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Most agriculture in Nepal is rainfed.

The farm under the assessment has soil with a pH below 5.0. Lime application to these soil (liming) makes them less acidic. It breaks the barrier that fixes nutrients and ensures crops access to vital soil nutrients that unleash their productivity potential. Soil amendment with lime needs to be at least a month in advance of planting the intended crop. It requires thoroughly mixing the lime powder into the soil. The crop response from the treated soil is gradually visible, particularly during the second cropping season. Lime application takes place after the soil is pulverized very well. Most small cereals (for example \u201ctef\u201d, Eragrostis tef, wheat and barley) need tillage at least four times to create a good environment for the small seeds to emerge and quickly compete effectively with the weeds.\nTreating exhausted acidic soils enhances the availability of nutrients that otherwise remain fixed by non-leaching mineral elements in the soil. Application of lime along with organic fertilizers improves soil structure, soil pore space, and soil infiltration capacity.  Treating acid soil increases crop production and productivity of the soil. It reduces labour costs relative to output, since it leads to a relatively high yield from a small area. The practice helps to stop land being converted from cropping to grazing. Even when this conversion occurs, the grazing land itself is poor because of the acidity and may be abandoned and simply become unproductive degraded land.\nHowever, availability and accessibility of lime, transportation, and manual application to the farmland are challenging. Based on the degree of soil acidity, the amount of lime required can be high. Apart from the large quantity required (4 or more tonnes per ha), the price per unit is discouraging to smallholder farmers. The high price, poor supply, and delays in delivery are the main challenges to effectively address the prevailing issues of soil acidity.COMMENTS:The technology applied on the farmland that is located closer to the homestead.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Chemicals|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery","type_id":"993, 2073, 1188, 1191","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 910, 914, 909, 915","readiness_level":"7.

During Soviet times there were no tree nurseries in this region and seedlings had to be brought in from outside. Only the Pamir Biological Institute (PBI) was able to obtain seedlings for research purposes. A nursery of about 0.1 ha was established by one farmer on his own land. Tree species grown in the nursery include apple, peach, apricot, walnut, cherry and pear.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main goal of the project was to make varieties of tree species adapted to different climatic conditions in GBAO locally available. The seedlings are used for other MSDSP projects, such as orchards for soil stabilisation, and are also purchased by private land users for their own land. In addition, the land user was taught how to establish a business by selling seedlings to other land users. There is a strong need for quality tree seedlings in the whole region and even people from as far away as Ishkhashim (7 hour journey by car) travel to Vanj valley to purchase seedlings from this nursery. The economic benefit for the land user is very high as during one year he can make more than 18,000 TJS (4000 USD) of profit from selling seedlings while the investments in fertilisers are comparably small.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The steps necessary for the establishment of a tree nursery are the following: (1) a suitable plot of flat land is chosen by the farmer, (2) the plot is fenced with dead branches to protect it from roaming animals, (3) in March, the farmer prepares several wooden boxes filled with humid soil in which he distributes 10 kg of seeds of different tree species and varieties. Those boxes have to be irrigated for a month while the seeds are germinating, (4) in April, the nursery plot is ploughed along the contour using animal traction and 1 ton of organic manure, 20 kg of phosphor and 2.5 kg of nitrogen is mixed with the soil, (5) seedlings are planted linearly along the contour with small irrigation ditches running parallel to the planting lines. These ditches were automatically established through the ploughing process, (6) two more times during the first season another 3 kg of nitrogen are applied. In the second year the grafting process is started and in the third year the farmer starts selling the seedlings. The farmer therefore splits up the nursery plot in three parts so that he can always have newly planted seedlings at the same time with second-year seedlings for grafting and third-year seedlings for selling\nNatural \/ human environment: The technology was adopted by two other farmers from the village who had successfully applied to MSDSP for financial support for seeds and fertilisers. Many other farmers from neighbouring villages are interested. The bridge that is currently being built to allow for more trade between Afghanistan and Tajikistan might open further market opportunities for the land user. Furthermore this type of experience is being widely replicated in other districts and supported by MSDSP.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): reduction of vegetation cover, erosion of slope areas, decline of soil fertility,\nFuture (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Cropland: Ct: Tree and shrub croppingSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation|Policy|Inclusion and Equity-Oriented Policies|Appropriate technology promotion|Support for grassroots innovation","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206, 1076, 1088, 1095, 1136, 1111, 1110","use_cases":"Production|improved plant varieties|Farm management|income increase|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"897, 902, 910, 1180, 916, 927, 915","readiness_level":"9.

They are given supplementary water until vegetation is established.  The pits are dug within national parks managed by the National Centre for Vegetation Cover Development and Combating Desertification (NCVC), which is the leader in this technology.\nPits may be located within wadis and sheyhib (small wadis), ranging in plots from ten to several hundred metres in length, and on high plateaux. The pits are often dug close to terraces and cross-wadi walls where runoff water is captured in the soil. Each plantation pit is rectangular, measuring (approx) 2m long, 1m wide, and up to 1m deep (depending on the depth of the soil). Spacing is from 3 to 10 metres between pits. The pits are excavated with mechanical diggers.\nPits are dug a year before planting, and they collect both runoff and the rich organic and mineral matter carried in the runoff. After one year, many annual and even perennial plants colonise the bottom of the pits. The trees and shrubs that are planted the most are Vachellia (Acacia) spp., Ziziphus spp. and Haxloylon spp. One (or two) seedlings are planted in the middle of each pit, without disturbing the existing vegetation as far as possible. These species attract bees, and beekeeping has been promoted alongside tree planting. Ziziphus honey is particularly high in value and Vachellia (acacia) honey is also good.\nThis water and nutrient harvesting technique is effective even in hyper-arid conditions, where rainfall may be less than 100 mm yearly. However, some supplemental irrigation is needed, and each pit is watered  - every 4 months over 3 years -  with a volume of water ranging from 20 to 100 litres each time per pit, depending on availability. Water is found in wadi beds and brought to the site in a bowser mounted on a lorry. Watering helps the plants to survive, and as it penetrates, it draws the roots down until they reach the water table. This is when watering can be stopped.\nAlthough the costs are high, the results are generally very satisfactory regarding the survival rate. The local impact is significant when there are large blocks of pits and\/ or greater numbers of pits per hectare (where this is possible). Over the last five years, a million pits have been dug.\nAbdulla Al Eissa, the park manager, formulated the technical design of the pits, and FAO through the project \u0022Strengthening MoEWA\u0027s Capacity to implement its Sustainable Rural Agricultural Development (SRAD) Programme (2019-2025) UTF\/SAU\/051\/SAU\u0022 has been responsible for technical advice on locating pits, spacing and layout timing of operations, fertilization and planting operations.

Kenya, the conditions are ideal for agricultural activities. There is plenty of rainfall (2100 mm\/year) which is usually reliable. However in the year 2000, the river Kapingazi dried up for the first time since many decades during a dry spell. This led to community activities that finally came up with a system of vegetative interventions to strengthen the riparian zones. The intervention consists of tree planting and establishment of grass strips along the river. Napier grass is planted to stabilize steep slopes and to supply material for the construction of tea baskets.\nPurpose of the Technology: The goals of this technology are manifold. Firstly, the vegetation prevents surface water and eroded soil flowing from the agricultural fields directly into the river. Therefore, sediments and chemicals used on the field are retained in the riparian soils and do not pollute the river. Surface water flow from runoff during heavy storms is slowed down and infiltration on soils covered by grass and trees is increased. As a result more groundwater is recharged during the wet seasons, which can be released during the dry season. Thus peak or flood flows are reduced and low flows are improved. Damage during flood flows on the riverbank (through erosion and destabilizing the riparian vegetation) as well as damages of floods downstream can be reduced or avoided.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Before planting the indigenous trees, water guzzlers like eucalyptus trees were cut down. Indigenous seedlings were planted right along the river at a distance of 2m. Between the trees and the tea plantation a grass strip of up to 10m is established. Some trees were planted scattered on the grass strip. The young trees are surrounded by grasses which are cut regularly every 2 weeks. This reduces competition and enhances growth of the trees. As soon as the trees are big enough, they function as a source of firewood, they can be pruned every 5 months.\nNatural \/ human environment: The studied plot is situated right below the natural mountain forest of Mt. Kenya at the south-eastern slope. The source of Kapingazi River can be found at 1.5 km of walking distance upslope of the plot. Agricultural circumstances are good because of the fertile, volcanic plots and the abundant precipitations. However, the terrain is quite steep.\nThe zone which is used for tea production reaches from an elevation of 1700 m.a.s.l to 2000 m.a.s.l. Most tea farmers own between 4 and 20 acres. The area of the riparian zone covers 6 m from the river edge and belongs to the government. Since the harvest of the tea leaves requires a high labour input, local workers are hired. Most of the harvest is done during the rainy season because the tea plants are growing fast in this period. For the tea production only the youngest leaves are used, transported in a basket on the worker\u2019s back to the tea factory in the evening.COMMENTS:Since the technology is only used by one farmer at a single spot, it does not make sense to indicate the area. Furthermore, the length along the river is more important than the area.Major crop: Tea and Napier grass\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The main land use problems are pollution of the riverwater, low rainwater storage that provokes floods, too few water during the dry season and riverbank erosion.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): The main problem is the few water in the dry season that prevents irrigation.\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: Additionally, few food crops are planted in a relatively small homegarden.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|forestry management","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 920, 921, 918, 910, 914, 897, 898, 927","readiness_level":"7.

The wood can be used to establish a building or to generate income on the market.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Manuel FischerAt the foot slopes of Mt. Kenya a farmer has developed a technology to protect the own land plot from riverbank erosion. The technology consists of three main measures: A wall along the riverbed, trees that are aligned on the wall as well as beside it and Napier grass wildly scattered between the trees. The wall was built on a highly exposed spot of the riverbank. Trees along and beside the wall ensure its stability. The combination of the two measures results in an effective protection of the riverbank in terms of erosion. Side effects of the technology are higher runoff during the dry season, better water quality due to less erosion and an improved riparian habitat for animals and plants.\nPurpose of the Technology: For a small scale farmer, planting of trees can have advantages in an economic, an ecologic and an aesthetic point of view. The trees stabilize the soil, allow the riparian vegetation to establish, and prevent major damages through flooding. Furthermore, there are several advantages of an intact riparian zone, such as enhanced biodiversity, increased water quality as well as retention of agrochemicals. The trees also work as a kind of bank account, since the prices for wood are quite high. Trees can be cut and sold from time to time to generate an income that can be used for further investments like local entrepreneurship or building houses for family members. Last but not least, the farmer emphasized the beautiful appearance of the trees including the relatively cool micro- climate the trees are able to provide during the hot months of the dry period.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The trees were planted during the rainy season. Braches are pruned regularly and provide mulch material as well as fire wood. When trees are reaching maturity they will selectively be cut and replanted. The Napier grass is cut regularly for fodder to be feed to animals. At this particular time, there is a regular hay yield (weed). Seedlings for trees and the grasses are produced on site. Occasional pruning ensures fuel wood supply.\nNatural \/ human environment: The plot is situated at the western side of Mt. Kenya in its foot zone, a moderate hilly region. Actually, the foot zone is a transition area between the humid mountain forest above elevations of 2500 m.a.s.l and the semi-arid savannah zone below 2000 m a.s.l. Although the region is located in the rain shadow of Mt. Kenya, there is just enough precipitation (740mm) to sustain rain fed agriculture and the farmers even benefit from a water project. During the last decades, the region has experienced a still continuing population growth which increases population pressure in the area. The good accessibility and the moderate tourism allow even off-farm income-generation.COMMENTS:Trees\/ shrubs species: Cypress, Grevillea, indigenous trees\nFruit trees \/ shrubs species: Napier grass\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Surface water pollution and riverbank degradation as well as a diminished habitat of riparian flora and fauna.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): An unstable riparian zone being eroded by the river and unattractive aesthetics.\nProblems \/ comments regarding forest use: The purpose of the forest is mainly in a protective way.

The method involves digging trenches which have grass-stabilized banks, or simply planting grass strips and vegetative barriers across the slope to reduce runoff. This method, locally referred to as \u2018progressive terracing\u2019, is more adaptable by individual farmers across the country. In the study conducted by Kagabo et al. (2013) in the highlands of Buberuka Region of Rwanda, it was noted that net increment in yields and returns on investment increased with the age of terraces, since the capital costs of terracing were easily recovered. These terraces also showed more resilience, some being over 30 years old and still effective.  Along the contour band, soil from the upper parts of the slope is removed and deposited above by creating a series of discontinuous trenches  in order to extend the flat terrain. Over 5-10 years, the terraces become enlarged and form a terrace along the contour, such that the slopes are transformed over time into level bench terraces (but never %).\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of this technology is to reduce runoff and soil erosion on the slope and to improve soil quality and soil moisture retention. Grass strips or living hedgerows are intended to both trap sediments and facilitate the slow formation of terraces.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The establishment of trenches combined with living hedges or grassed lines is less labor intensive and requires less skilled labor. Regular maintenance  banks on which living hedges are planted, to seasonally stream living hedges to minimize the competition of nutrients and water with plants. To efficiently use these terraces it is advisable to introduce intensive and rentable cropping systems or agroforestry with fruits and forage trees.\nNatural \/ human environment: This technology was reported to be very resilient as trenches combined with living hedges or grassed lines of 20+ year old are still effective in controlling soil erosion. However, the soil quality on these formed terraces between alleys does not homogenize 100% over the course of time. Large soil fertility gradients with marked spatial difference in both soil quality and crop yield from their upper parts downwards of the terraces is observed.

As a remedy, farmers have started using trenches commonly referred to fanya juu, fanya chini. This is one of the technologies intended to help reduce soil and water runoff on cultivated and degraded land under banana in order to increase water infiltration and improve soil fertility.\nThe trenches are normally established during the dry season on small pieces of land of about 0.5 to 1 acre, with slopes ranging from 16 to 30% in areas with high rainfall. The trenches are measured, using a tape measure, 0.5 m deep and 50 m long banana planted at a spacing of 3 metres between plants to allow suckers to grow in addition to applying cow dung during maintenance which is locally obtained at no cost.\nImplements and materials required to construct the trenches include ropes, spades, and hoes. Once the trenches have been constructed, natural grass can be allowed to grow or elephant grass planted on both sides of the trenches to stabilize the soils and reduce sediments falling into the trenches.\nIn this practice, the land user starts with identifying soil erosion hotspots within the banana plantation where the trenches are to be established. This is followed by looking for labour and money to pay for digging the trenches.\nTrenches are effective in reducing soil and water runoffs under banana production immediately when it starts raining. It is worth to note that, the costs associated with paying labour for digging the trenches and buying inputs are higher during establishment compared to the costs of maintenance; this is because during maintenance the land user only needs to pay for labour to remove sediments from the trenches.\nEstablishing trenches under banana plantations requires the land user to be provided with prior knowledge and skills through training on the proper procedures on establishing the trench using the correct measurements of 0.5 m deep and 50 m long with banana planted at a spacing of 3 metres with the help of a tape measure, ropes, spades, and hoes and as required inputs.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|disaster management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 910, 914, 918, 920, 1154","readiness_level":"7.

In hilly areas like Bundibugyo, soil and water runoff is reported to be of paramount importance to farmers growing cocoa on steep slopes. To counteract the problems associated with such cultivation farmers have come up with a strategy of constructing contour trenches. Contour trenches are dug structures, perpendicular to the slopeline, of a certain depth and width in a field of any kind. In this way runoff soil, together with run-off water is caught in such structures and thereby, kept on the field.\nIn this plantation, the technology reduces water runoff, increases water infiltration and also improves soil fertility. As reported by a cocoa farmer, trenches should be dug in dry season. The  numbers of trenches in the plantation depends on the size and the slope of the land. Normally in an acre, 10-15 trenches can be constructed. On establishment of these trenches in hilly area, they are 1m deep, 0.5m wide and 30m long on average along horizontal contour lines. Necessary materials to construct these trenches include a measuring tape, ropes, spades, and hoes.\nThe soils can be stabilized such that they are not washed into the trenches again. Some grasses are therefore planted on the sides of the trenches. After allocating suitable places for trenches, labour is locally available. However, some farmers who grow cocoa don\u2019t want to dig trenches because it is laborious and requires larger land sizes.\nManagement is relatively cheaper as it only involves, emptying the trenches periodically.COMMENTS:In hilly areas, trenches are dug to reduce the speed of running water.

The basic stove is built of fire bricks, house bricks, cement and coated with a natural mix of straw and mud. It is a traditional concept based upon former soviet stoves, that was modernised and adapted to improve the energy efficiency, and make use of the materials that are available to the people. It is able to burn coal, wood, and tapac, and is designed to reduce the amount of natural resources used to meet the household energy needs.\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of the 2-room stove is to replace the traditional cast iron pig style of stove, with a more modern and energy efficient stove that can be used effectively for cooking and the heating of two rooms. The 2-room stove is designed to filter the hot air between the rooms and the use the bricks as a thermal sink for heat retention. As most of the houses are made of mud bricks, the heat from the stove will conduct through the walls, which will act as radiators to emit warmth into the room. The 2-room stove also means that cooking activities can be conducted inside the house in a smoke free environment.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The stove requires basic training in construction by a skilled technician, however after a three day training course the local trades people are able to build their own stoves with limited supervision. The stove is constructed from 45 fire bricks and 400 household bricks, the hot plate and stove doors are bought second hand from the markets, and metal bars are used to reinforce the structure. There are two smoke vents in the wall between the two rooms to allow the smoke to filter its way along the snake like chimney until it vents through the roof. The final structure is coated in straw and mud which acts as an insulation layer.\nNatural \/ human environment: There is a high reliance on natural resources in Shahtuti Bolo. The average family burns several tons of tapac (straw dung mix) and wood each year. The surrounding mountain area is sparsely vegetated and does not even provide enough fuel for the village during the harsh winter months. This is supplemented by buying wood from the neighbouring villages. One tapac weighs one kilo, this is organic matter that can no longer be used for soil enhancement, but for fuel purposes. It is estimated that the 2-room stove will reduce the amount of fuel burnt by 20-40% depending upon the household.COMMENTS:The village of Shahtuti BoloMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The over exploitation of natural resources that have lead to soil erosion and degradation of the soil structure.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): The land has become increasingly unproductive over the last few decades.

This has been the practice since 2019, and gives the best of both worlds.\nConsiderations regarding time of undersowing include the following:\n\u2022Sowing at the 8-10 leaf stage is often confronted with adverse the field\/weather conditions which are almost never optimal.\n\u2022Sowing together increases competition between grass and maize, and therefore lower yields of maize: however, the earlier you sow the grass, the better the effect on prevention of nitrogen leaching.\n\u2022Timing of sowing has an influence on the choice of grass and the amount of seed required:\n- Early stage (simultaneous sowing and at the 1-2 leaf stage): tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) develops and grows slowly and therefore leads to less competition with the maize: 15 kg\/ha of seed is required.\n- When sowing at the 4-6 leaf stage, a combination of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) is the preferred grass mixture: again, sown at 15 kg\/ha. The effect on maize yield is even positive when sowing at this stage - possibly due to the mechanical weed control, which stimulates mineralisation.\n- Sowing at the 8-10 leaf stage: Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) is used at 20 kg\/ha.  This has the vigour to grow under the maize when maize is already tall enough tolerate this dominating grass.\nThe grass must be sown between, and not within the maize rows. A motorised hoe with seed box is used. This machine weeds between the rows of the maize and at the same time sows the grass. RTK-GPS tracking is needed to do this correctly. \nWeed control is not an easy job in this system, and the earlier you sow the grass, the more difficult is the problem. Because there are two different crops in the field at the same time, you have to keep both in consideration when selecting plant protection products. Therefore, it is not recommended to use this technique in fields with high weed pressure, especially not where there are grassy weeds.\nAfter the harvest, the cover crop \u2013 grass \u2013 has already formed a dense carpet. This gives protection to the soil during harvest and no further soil tillage is needed, or desirable in the autumn. The grass can then be ploughed in or killed with a herbicide in the early-spring ready for a new crop. \nThis undersowing technique demonstrates a decrease of N residue compared to \u2018no catch\/ cover crop\u2019 and \u2018sowing of catch\/ cover crop after harvest\u2019 every year and at every location. This is a positive finding. However, farmers find it hard to implement, due to the possible negative effect on the yield of the maize and difficulties with weed control.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Vehicles and machinery|Digital technologies|GPS|Advanced positioning systems|Geospatial technologies","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1194, 1015, 1028, 1055, 1052","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change mitigation|minimize pesticide use|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|optimization of resource use for better production|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 910, 914, 917, 919, 926, 922, 909, 912","readiness_level":"7.

During rainy season, level of water rises in the stream due to which land mass field of around area was degraded. This technology is used to control the land mass and water flowing from upper region to the lower region of the hill. The natural stream was modified to deep and more sloppy. And surrounding walls were made by piling up stones dams and tighten them by metal wires. These dams decrease the slope gradient and reduce the velocity of water flow and promote the deposition of eroded materials.\nPurpose of the Technology: There was no problem of landslide and downstream flood before. But after the road construction, soil became loose resulting in the occurrence of downstream flood. It caused massive destruction of agricultural fields and disturbed settlement areas. Also, stone and gravel during landslide and stream flood used to be deposited and block the flow of the water. So land user invented by this technology to control and reduce the effects of downstream flood.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Land users and other villagers took the initiative to carry out the technology. Stones were abundantly found in the stream that were utilized to make the dams on lining the stream. Dozer was used to deepen the stream and increase the slope of stream. Stones were piled up and tied by iron wires on the bank of stream by local farmers themselves with their own investment.\nNatural \/ human environment: The area where this technology has been used is a hilly area. Soil fertility in that area is low or medium which differs according to the place. Due to landslide and downstream flood, sand and gravel get deposited in the cropland, so its fertility is very low. No crops can be grown in there. This technology helps to control further degradation of land but could\u0027t help to restore natural quality of land.\nThis area is semi arid area. Due to the proper supply of water the area is prevented from drying. People living in that area are mainly farmers and depend on agriculture for livelihood.

The technology has the portential to generate considerable nutritional benefits, employment and additional income which, in return, is invested in sustainable land management practices. To date, the demand for mushrooms increases as the result of a fast population growth having less income and food supply. Hence, a growing number of farmers adopt the mushroom production technology. \nTo establish such a technology, materials required include: cotton, a metallic drum (100 litres), a gunny bag of the size of 100kg, water, tarpuline, lime\/maize brand, polyethene bags, banana leaf stock, cooking stove, firewood, mushroom seeds, tooth picks\/nails and strings of approx. 100m length.\nListed below are the activities \/ procedures required for the establishment of a mushroom cultivation in a homestead.\n-Water-soak the cotton into the drum and cover the drum with a gunny bag\n-Remove the water out of the drum. The soaked cotton remains in the drum for around 2 hours\n-Remove the soaked cotton on to a taurpline sheet and mix it with cultural lime\/rice brand \/maze brand that is placed on the taurpline\n-Get black polythene bags and pack 1 kg of cotton into each polythene bag\n-Place the banana leaf stock at the bottom of the drum and fill it with 20 litres of water\n-Cut the gunny bag in the middle and cover the inside part of the drum to prevent burning of the cotton in the polythene bags while boiling\n-Place the cotton in polythene bags into the drum and put the drum on the cooking stove to heat. The first line of polythene bags should be bent to prevent boiling water to enter the cotton\n-Cover the drum tight with gunny bags\n-Steam for around 2 hours\n-Remove the firewood to cool until the next day\n-Then remove the cooled cotton and place it on the tarpuline\n-Buy mushroom seeds, smash the seeds (i.e, one pack of seeds mixes 2 gardens)\n-Each kg of cotton mixed containing the mushroom seeds should be squeezed into the black polythene bags in a ball shape and tied on top\n-Then get a tooth pick or a nail and pinch down 3 to 4 holes for air to come out\n-Tie strings to the packed polythene bags and hang them for 14 days. (Strings enable sprouting on the gardens from all sides). Having moderate light, water needs to be applied twice a day or thrice in case of dry season during a period of 3 weeks\n-After 7 days, the mushrooms start sprouting\n-Leave the mushroom on the garden for 2-3 days before harvesting\n-Once mushrooms are ripe, get a sharp knife and cut the stem carefully\nOn harvesting, the first week yields 8 Kg every second day, thereafter 3 kg of mushrooms every second day during the second month. Drums can be replaced every after 4 months so that  the cost of maintenance is kept relatively low.\nMushrooms are a source of nutrients and proteins (Protein content, 3-7% when fresh and 25- 40% when dry). They are useful in preventing diseases and have medicinal values. Environmentally, the growing of mushrooms reduces pollution through bio-conservation and improves on crop production since harvested manure from the used mushroom \u2018garden\u2019 can be recycled as fertilizers for vegetable gardens at homes. \nDespite the advantages, the technology faces various challenges: These include lack of a workplace (physical facility), lack of finance and skills on hygiene and sterilization, compost preparation, market challenges that include instability and decrease in sales prices of the products and inputs. Environmental factors like humidity, Ph, light and ventilation if not controlled may influence the growing process. Insects, diseases and animals due to the enclosed environment in which the mushrooms grow are a high risk. This may result in disease infestations like snails infestation.\nHowever, maintenance  costs of this technology are cheaper compared to establishment costs  with minimum costs required for replacing worn out poles, replacing drums which can be at least every after 5 months.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 994, 1188, 1196, 1206, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Farm management|income increase|Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Supply chain management|support to consumption and nutrition","use_cases_id":"910, 1180, 897, 898, 916, 921, 939, 944","readiness_level":"8.

The technology is seen as a cheap and healthy solution to food insecurity and runaway unemployment in Kampala\u2019s slum. It is preferred by farmers because it\u0027s cheap, high-yielding and promoting food security while maximizing land and water use.\nThis technology is practiced in the slum area of Kisenyi 2 zone, Kamokya parish, Kampala District and was established in 2015, where the farmer got farming training from Kampala City Council Authority through demonstrations in the urban farming program. The main reasons for its establishment were; the ease to establishment and management, space optimization, no special skills required and affordability.\nTo establish such a technology the  farmer started by collecting huge sacks of banana leaves that had been dumped around the neighborhood.\nBlack soil was mixed with chicken manure that was available. Small pebble stones were added and strong sticks placed in the middle of the sack, right from bottom to top. The sack was then filled with soil, leaving the stones erect in the middle. For an optimal production, the farmer used bags with a containing capacity of 50 to 100 kilograms. Additonal items were one polyethylene (food-safe bag. ie: rice bag) and a pipe of the height of the bag, opened at both ends, 15 to 20cm long.\nThe complete system consists of 50 kilos of soil, 25 kilos of fertilizer (compost, manure) which is adjusted according to the\nquality of the soil plus 15 kilos of stones (3 to 7 cm diameter).\nIn some sacks the farmer grows tomatoes, cabbages and carrots. Usually the crops with big roots, like carrots, go on the top, and the sides are reserved for cabbages with small roots, she says. The sack garden is watered on a daily basis, twice a day if the weather is dry and once a day if the weather is humid. There is no such a thing as a crop-growing season. The garden is ever green, even during the dry season. The farmer makes 0.6$ selling spinach to neighbors, and 0.84$ selling produce to the market. This translates to about 27.8$ per month, after deducting expenses.\nSack gardening is very advantageous to the farmer and other farmers are trained in the technology by the farmer who started it. The farmer receives an equivalent of 1.39$ a day. For 20 training days this totals to 27.8$ a month from tutoring a women group in Kamokya. This additonal income helps the farmer securing enough money to meet needs like school fees, food and utility payments. It also provides a secure source of nutritional food, facilitates growing of vegetables in areas without suitable soils or adequate space, promotes efficient and effective utilization of available water and nutrients.COMMENTS:The farmer has several sacks with different vegetables.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Alternative food production|production of food in limited spaces (e.g. vertical farming)|Farm management|income increase|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|Supply chain management|support to consumption and nutrition","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 934, 935, 910, 1180, 915, 916, 920, 921, 939, 944","readiness_level":"7.

This crop is planted in December\/January and harvested from May through to July\/August. The growing period mainly falls in the driest period of the year and therefore requires irrigation.\nIn addition to water, the plants need fertiliser to ensure healthy growth and good production. Nitrogen is the most important macronutrient for plants and high crop productivity can only be achieved if sufficient nitrogen is available. Nitrogen is also the most limiting nutrient in most areas of Nepal\u2019s midhills. Traditionally farmers applied farmyard manure; but in many places this is being supplemented or entirely replaced by inorganic fertiliser, mainly urea. However, fertiliser prices have increased substantially in recent years and this type of fertiliser is often not available in  sufficient quantities in areas away from the roadheads. At the same time cultivation practices are intensifying with greater cropping intensities and more nutrient demanding crops as local varieties are replaced by hybrids and new crops are introduced. This can easily lead to nutrient mining and soil fertility decline unless there is an equivalent increase in inorganic or mineral fertilisation.\nCattle urine is a viable alternative to mineral fertiliser; it is nitrogen rich. The urine is collected in improved cattle sheds (fact sheet on urine collection QT NEP1). For constant fertiliser application and to reduce the water requirement, the collected urine can be added to the irrigation water in the drip irrigation tanks (fertigation). Farmers who have tried this say it has increased the yield of bitter gourd and other cash crops, in some cases by as much as 100%. Other crops that can be grown using drip irrigation with a water-urine mixture are cauliflower, cucumber, and other types of gourd.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Intensifying cultivation practices with either 1) inadequate application of fertilisers leading to a decline in soil fertility and the mining of soil nutrients or 2) application of too much fertiliser causing environmental problems through excessive leaching, and losses of fertiliser in surface runoff and consequent eutrophication or nitrification of streams, ponds, or groundwater. Also, irrigation water is in short supply during 6 to 8 months of the year. Fertigation allows about 20 to 30% of the irrigation water to be replaced by urine.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|optimization of resource use for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|income increase|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 909, 916, 921, 920, 910, 914, 908, 1180, 912","readiness_level":"7.

This can be considered a SLM technology because it protects the crops from wild animals which in turn prevents erosion (both soil and water), adds nitrogen to the soil (i.e., by leguminous crops), and helps in nutrient cycling.  Furthermore, time is freed up for the farmer to carry out other SLM activities.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Tshering YangzomIn the region of Drochukha, Bhutan, the foremost challenge faced by rural communities is crops damage by wildlife. Land users in this area contend with damage inflicted by a variety of wild animals, including wild boar, barking deer, sambar deer, monkeys, porcupines, bears, and rats. To mitigate crop damage by wildlife, the land users of Drochukha have implemented a unique solution by strategically placing dummy tigers to deter these animals and safeguard their crops.\nIn 2018, a woman from Drochukha initiated the idea of using dummy tigers to protect crops, and it proved to be highly successful. Following this, other residents also adopted the practice. Farmlands situated near the forest\u0027s periphery experience the most significant crop damage by wild animals. By placing dummy tigers near the forest\u0027s edge, the land users have not only reduced wildlife attacks in the peripheral regions but also significantly decreased such incidents in the central areas. To protect their crops from wild animals, they procured a dummy tiger at a cost of Nu. 3,380 (about USD 40) from Bajo town in Wangduephodrang Dzongkhag and another dummy tiger costing Nu. 2,000 (about USD 25) from the Indian market in Jaigaon. The land users constructed a raised wooden platform by placing four wooden poles in the ground and adding planks over them to support the dummy tigers, ensuring that they faced the forest.\nThe implementation of dummy tigers (two) has yielded numerous benefits for 21 households in the region. With the adoption of this innovative approach, Drochukha farmers have been able to increase their crop production and rejuvenate previously unused lands. Dummy tigers effectively safeguard standing crops and prevent wildlife depredation. Maintaining standing crops in the fields is essential to prevent erosion, both of soil and water, while also contributing nitrogen to the soil through the cultivation of leguminous crops and facilitating nutrient cycling. An important aspect of employing dummy tigers is that it prevents land users from resorting to fatal methods of crop protection that may involve the killing of wildlife. Human-wildlife conflicts have thus been reduced. The primary current concern of the land users of Drochukha is the fading colour of the dummy tigers, and they are eager for improved interventions that may involve mobile and sound-producing tigers.\nThe Agriculture Machinery Centre (AMC) and the Dzongkhag Agriculture Office (DAO) have joined forces to create an IoT-based animal-repellent system. This system, positioned at the field\u0027s periphery, comprises three primary components: a speaker, a receptor card, and an amplifier. Once connected to an owner\u0027s smartphone, the system allows for the remote playback of various animal sounds. One system, consisting of a single receptor card, can be linked to up to five users. Additionally, two LED flashlights are integrated into the system to deter wild boars at night through powerful pulse flashes. The complete system comes at a cost of Nu. 30,000. Moreover, in their most recent endeavors, AMC and DAO are currently developing a robotic tiger capable of moving its head and limbs, enabling it to patrol the guardhouse and serve as a further deterrent to wildlife. The technology is being piloted as a project to evaluate its effectiveness in the field through trials.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Digital technologies|Internet of Things (IoT)|Robotics|Sensor","type_id":"993, 1015, 1030, 1035, 1036","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|disaster management|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 917, 1154, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

However some farmers have experienced difficulties in cultivating vegetables due to various challenges such as the soil type, for example clay or compacted soil, ineffective water seepage as well as the soil\u2019s low nutrient content making it unsuitable for agricultural purposes. Consequently, the problems that the farmers often faced included vegetables of inferior quality, outbreaks of diseases, as well as surges of insects and pests which typically reduce yields by approximately 30%. In order to increase production and cultivate at a preferable period of time, farmers often applied chemical fertilizer in combination with animal compost. However the production outputs and quality of the produce were not up to expectations if compared to agricultural practices that do not involve the use of chemicals. It has been noted that vegetables grown with the use of chemical fertilizers cannot be kept for a long period of time as they tend to spoil more quickly, despite the increase in production yields. In 2015 an International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) Programme introduced a technique to produce effective micro-organisms (EM) and encouraged people to use these to improve the nutrient content of the soil and thereby enhance the quality of home garden vegetables as well as other potential crops. The farmers gained an interest in EM and began to produce it according to the programme\u2019s instructions. The production of EM is actually relatively easy, and farmers can use organic waste from vegetables such as Chinese mustard (Brassica juncea), morning glory and water spinach mixed with 1kg of sugar and 0.5 kg of molasses (if available, or it can be excluded, but it should be available at an agricultural produce outlet). Firstly the organic waste should be sliced\/chopped into small pieces and then sugar and molasses are added which are then all mixed in a 20 litre container. Then a one metre long stick should be used to mix all the ingredients and the container lid should then be sealed properly. Once these steps have been completed, the EM production container should avoid sunlight and be stored in the shade so as to ensure the quality of EM. After one week the container can be opened to mix the ingredients again and then it can continue to remain in the shade for another month. Thereafter, EM mixture is ready for use and one table spoon should be added to 10 litres of water, and once this has been mixed well it can be applied to the vegetables in the home garden by using water cans. Watering involves pouring the solution from the leaves to the stems or to the roots of the vegetables. After the application of the EM solution it was noted that there were more earthworms around the vegetable plots and also that there was an increase in soil moisture and nutrients. Furthermore it was also noted that the soil was previously relatively white and compacted and not black and porous allowing for good water seepage. In this way water is absorbed by the soil in the plot rather than running off over the surface. Plant pathogens and pests\/insects such as red ants and leaf worms was reduced. As a result, the vegetables grew well with a good average weight, and there was an increase in both the quality and the yield. As a comparison, in the past farmers used to be able to harvest 5-6 kg per plot, but now they are capable of securing 12-15kg per plot. However, weeds still remain a problem and these include Eleusine indica and thorny grass which compete for nutrients with the crops. It is a challenge for the farmers to control these weeds including other natural vegetables.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biologicals|Biotechnologies|Biofertilizers and biopesticides|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 2100, 994, 1001, 1196, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|plant health|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|income increase|minimize pesticide use|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 906, 921, 909, 910, 1180, 926, 916, 920","readiness_level":"7.

However, if droughts occur or if the rainfall patterns are erratic, the production can be harmed. Furthermore, due to the lack of water, the land users usually leave their fields bare during the dry season. This results in an increase of wind erosion and in negative impacts on the soil biota due to its exposure to the sun.\nIn order to tackle these challenges, ponds of 4 m depth (1 m deeper than the groundwater table during the dry season) are used at household level. By building ponds, some fields can be irrigated during the dry season, thus crops can be grown the whole year round. In this case study, sweet potatoes are the main cash crop grown on the irrigated fields during the dry season. The vines can be transplanted to the fields during the beginning of the rainy season, resulting in a better productivity of the crop. Peanuts and cucumbers are other cash crops grown on the irrigated fields.\nAdditionally, fish are introduced to the pond. These fish, which are caught during fishing for consumption in the flooded rice fields or nearby streams, increase the resilience of the land users: On one hand, they generate additional income and on the other hand, they allow the land users to eat fish the whole year round.\nTo build the ponds, the land users of this case study benefited from the road construction. The constructer needed soil, and offered to dig a pond for free if they could use the soil. They only dug 2 of the total 4 meters depth of the pond. The land users had to hire someone to dig deeper, as the groundwater level drops below 3 meters soil level during the dry season. The additional benefits from the pond, the fish are introduced as fingerlings when they are caught with the bigger fish. They are fed with termites (around 5 kg of termite nest each day) and with rice bran (1 kg every 3 days). As the pond is only 2 years old, the maintenance activities like digging out the mud did not have to be done yet.\nThe analysed area is flat (slope \u003C 2%), tropic (dry and wet season), and the soils are mostly sandy or loamy. The soils contain little organic matter, the pH is sinking, the area has been deforested a long time ago and the groundwater table is rather high (1-2 m during the dry season, on the surface during wet season). and the groundwater table is rather high (3 m below soil level during the dry season, on the surface during the wet season).\nDue to climate change, the rainfalls are more erratic, temperatures rise and droughts are more recurrent. Rice is the predominant crop grown in the area, since it serves as staple food (mix subsistence and commercial activities). Rice is often grown in monocultures and harvested once a year. Once the rice is harvested (dry season), some farmer release cattle to the paddy fields to eat the straw and weeds. \nAs an addition to rice, most land users grow vegetable and fruits in small home gardens (subsistence) and complement their income by producing handicrafts or through off farm income \/ remittances from family members working in other places. The increasing migration rate (the young generation leaves the villages to work in the cities, garment industry or abroad) results in a decrease of available labour force in the area which has detrimental effects on the agricultural activities. Furthermore, the civil war in the 1970s (Khmer Rouge) led to the loss of agricultural knowledge that different NGOs try to re-establish.COMMENTS:There are 4 ponds in the village. They are used to irrigate the rice seedlings if the rainy season starts with delay, or if there is a drought after the seeding. In the dry season they are used to irrigate vegetables. Total area of the irrigated fields is around 1 ha.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Low soil fertility, lack of water during the dry season, more recurrent droughts due to climate change, leaving the fields bare after the rice is harvested which results in higher erosion and in the loss of soil biota, predominance of rice monocultures, low technical knowledge of the land users about land conservation measures.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Droughts, especially in the early rainy season. Rice seedlings need a reliable source of water.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1203, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|fisheries products management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 900, 914, 916, 920, 921, 918, 909","readiness_level":"7.

Concentrated on an area of 17,5 mln. ha, it is based on the full or partial pasture keeping of animals. Assuming that the average pasture\u2019s productivity is 1,7 centners\/ha (100%), forage availability during spring is 80%, 100 % in the summer \u0026amp; autumn \u0026amp; 60-65% during winter.  Total forage shortage in the Kyzylkum desert is about 540 thousand tons (15% of total demand). Considering this, production of reserve stock of forage is a relevant task.\nThe Kyzylkum desert has artesian wells, which each produce 13-15 l\/s. Water in the wells has neutral acidity (pH- 7,4) \u0026amp; medium salinity (Ec= 5.6-8.3 ds\/m). The technology of salinity tolerant crops (halophytes) for livestock forage was introduced on the basis of irrigation using water from these wells. The suitability of these feeds to various groups of livestock animals was determined and  a system of pre-feeding preparation was developed, taking into account the mineralization of irrigation water and quality of the halophytes (in the frame of CACILM).\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of this technology is land improvement through retention of  topsoil, rehabilitation of vegetation cover, prevention of overgrazing through reducing livestock pressure by organizing irrigated forage production.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The agricultural processes for establishing irrigated land are traditional and include plot leveling, plowing, chiseling, harrowing, sowing, cutting irrigation furrows and caring for the plantation. The following forage crops were successfully tested: winter cereal crops (Movlono barley, Kyrgyzskaya-1 rye, Prag Serebristy triticale, Kroshka millet), forage crops (Belozubaya maize, Aip-13150 pearl millet, Oq Zhuhori and Venichnoe sorghum, Sudan grass, Tashkentskaya and Eureca alfalfa, D-1 and D-2, common licorice) \u0026amp; forage halophytes (\u041a. scoparia (L.) Schrad, Bassia hyssopifolia (Pallas) O. Kuntze, S. altissima \u0026amp; Climacoptera lanata).\nNatural \/ human environment: Using mineralized waters for irrigation is only possible in soils with a light texture The introduction of crop rotation with halophytes, which remove up to 40% of salts from the soil, is also mandatory for the ecologically sustainable application of saline water. Traditionally livestock production is the main source of income for the population of the Kyzylkum and important to create family savings. To improve their livelihoods, livestock numbers are increased without consideration of the area or condition of pastures. Unsystematic grazing and pasture use beyond its capacity threatens biodiversity. Forage production facilitates the creation of a reserve stock of forage and alleviates pressure on the pastures. There are 63 artesian wells in the Kanimekh district, which can be used for irrigated crop farming on an area of 350-400 ha.

This technology has scaled up to 253 farmers on 6,000 rai (6.25 rai = 1 ha) at Ban Sokkompoon, Naso Sub-district, Kutchum District, Yasothon Province. The information has been received from Mr. Man Samsee, chief of the community and a farmer himself. The organic fertilizers used in the farmers\u2019 \ufb01elds are the compost from farm products and animal dungs, bio-fermented liquid from kitchen wastes, fermented liquid from neem (Azadirachta indica) for pest control, and green manure from Crotalaria juncia. The crops grown have been rice and vegetables, medicinal herbs and sesame, which are certi\ufb01ed as organic products; they command higher prices (more than 20%). Compost is the main organic fertilizer compared to others.\nThe objectives of organic farming are to produce organic crops, improve soil fertility, reduce wastes for friendly environment, get higher income and enhance good health for both producers and consumers. The procedure of making compost: The materials used for making compost are 1,000 kg of burnt rice husk, 3,000 kg of cattle manure\/poultry manure, 3,000 kg of farm residues, 1,000 kg of coarse bran, 500 kg of \ufb01ne bran, 1,000 kg of rice husk and 500 liters of organic-fermented liquid, all being thoroughly mixed by using a tractor. The allocation of compost: an amount of 300 kg of compost (20 bags) is given to each member to ferment at the farm by turning the bags occasionally before applying to a 3-rai land. There are several government organizations and private sectors that support this community of farmers, and a learning center was thus established. Up to now, the Land Development Department has been providing the knowledge of making compost and bio-fertilizer liquid; It also has been distributing green mature seeds and activators of bacteria and fungi. The Department of Agricultural Extension provided funding to establish the learning and training center and to produce materials used for training together with private sectors under CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility). The Cooperative Promotion Department supported by keeping household accounts. The local community administration set up several market places and promoted the products to be purchased by hospitals and restaurants. The organic crop products have been certi\ufb01ed by OACT (Organic Agriculture Certi\ufb01cation of Thailand) and IFOAM (International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements). The Department of Groundwater provided groundwater by drilling holes at 30-40 m deep. The Department of Alternative Energy Development and E\ufb03ciency provided solar cells as the source of energy. The noticeable bene\ufb01t of organic farming is that farmers have better health, the soil has become more fertile and the expenditure decreased. The farmers have been satis\ufb01ed of their own lifestyle and did not migrate to the city. They have been committed to developing their land by using organic fertilizers continuously. The average income has increased from 7,500 THB\/rai to 12,000 THB\/rai. The main problem has been the transportation of the organic fertilizers which are bulky, but it can be overcome by producing them on site where needed.COMMENTS:This area is rather flat, approx. 0-2% slope and thus no soil erosion.

It has been used by Hindu Society and has also been mentioned in Vedas. In 1950, James F. Martin made a liquid by lactating cow milk, using dung, sea water and yeast. It was claimed that it was capable of greening degrading land.\n  It is an organic product that has the potential to play the role of promoting growth and providing immunity in plant system. It consists of nine products i.e. cow dung, cow urine, milk, curd, jaggery, ghee, ripened banana, tender coconut and water.\n  This technology most importantly focuses on agronomic measures and conserves the manuring and composting. It does not lead to changes in slope profile of the land. Organic matter is used for soil surface treatment which increases the fertility of the soil. This agronomic measure is also combined with management measures where change in management of soil results in giving improved vegetable cover.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of Panchhagavya is to deal with major land problems such as soil infertility, less production of crops and water pollution due to use of fertilizers. It focuses on cropland where annual cropping is done. Annual crops are usually harvested within one or maximally within two years. Chemical and physical soil deterioration and biological degradation are the types of land degradation addresses by the technology.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: In a container, mix 5kg of cow dung and 1\/2kg of ghee. This mixture is stored in a shade for 4 days.On 5th day, the mixture is poured in a new container and cow milk, curd and cow urine is added to it. Then Jaggery is added by dissolving it in water. Ripened bananas are mashed and added to the above mixture with coconut water. This is stored for 30 days. Now, the mixture is stirred and mixed daily. This mixture is then sprayed to the crops. If the mixture is sprayed with hand sprayer then the nozzel must have greater pores. The preparation of Panchhagavya requires lot of products and takes around 30 days which makes it a bit costly.\nNatural \/ human environment: The Panchhagavya thus produced is then sprayed in the agriculture fields. So, this can be used as a substitute for fertilizers as a type of organic manure. It can help promote greenery. Panchhagavya is prepared indoors in huge quantities and may be used overtime as required.COMMENTS:The use of Panchhagavya is specially seen in different sates of India and Nepal.

Recently, with the availability of diverse industrial products the use of plastic has become a popular technology to cover soils. The impermeable plastic mulch prevents water evaporation. Furthermore condense water built under the impermeable plastic sheets drop back to soil; thus, plastic mulching in combination with the highly efficient drip irrigation substantially saves water for irrigation and it makes it as well suitable to areas faced by water shortage. Generally, black opaque plastic is used, which stops weed growth and in consequences also the attraction of harmful insects. Less weed mean also less competition for soil nutrients and therefore better growth of the crop. Another positive aspect of the weed control is the labor saving otherwise needed for weeding. In addition, plastic mulches play a role in preventing soil erosion and water saturation of the soil. At a nutshell, using plastic mulch combined with drip irrigation saves water for irrigation, reduces the number of harmful insects, and last but not least saves labor and time (FAO, 2017).\nThe eggplant cultivation in combination with plastic mulch and drip irrigation was introduced by the HARVEST project in 2014. This technology was employed on a farm which formerly grew rice on 1410 square meters of land. The farm comprised 1740 eggplants planted in 20 rows covered by plastic mulch. Eggplant is an annual vegetable plant that matures in well composted soil at temperatures above 20\u00b0C. The soil should be kept moist and at the same time water logging has to be avoided.\nOn the above mentioned farm the technology has been installed as follows: On the already prepared soil (the soil has been ploughed and dried at three separate times) the farmer created a ridge in each row that itself measures 1 meter in width  and 20 centimeters in height. The distance between each row was 1 meter. The drip irrigation pipes run along the rows, which were watered after installation. Then, the rows were covered by the plastic mulch at 1.50 meters in width. Next, soil was placed on the plastic sides to hold and protect it against gusts of wind. In order to create a growing space for the eggplants the farmer cut out round windows of 8 cm in diameter along the plastic rows making sure that there is gap of 60 cm) between each window (matches with the holes of the drip irrigation). Finally, eggplant seedlings were planted in the holes. Bamboos sticks near each eggplant provided first support to the seedlings and later on, hold the plants when they are grown and bear fruit. \nThis technology is economically beneficial as can substantially increase his income. In the interviews the land users reported that without this technology, after deducting the investment and maintenance costs, they generated a net income of only 30%. However, after application of the technology their net income increased up to 70% (as long as the crop was not affected by disease). Furthermore it freed up the farmers\u2019 time to fulfill other important tasks.COMMENTS:\u1782\u17c4\u1798\u17b6\u1793 \u17e0\u17e5\u1780\u17d2\u1794\u17b6\u179b\u179f\u1798\u17d2\u179a\u17b6\u1794\u17cb\u1799\u1780\u179b\u17b6\u1798\u1780\u1795\u1784\u178a\u17c2\u179a\u17d4SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization","type_id":"993, 1188","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|income increase|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|minimize pesticide use|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 1180, 914, 916, 920, 921, 926, 915, 909","readiness_level":"7.

The predominant geology is quartzite, shale, schist, conglomerate and dune sand. The soils of this area are generally acidic and nutrient-poor occurring, on moderate to steep slopes, ranging from 5 m to 1,220 m above sea level. The area receives summer and winter rainfall with an annual average of around 650 to 700 mm. The Knysna fires were the worst wildfire disaster in South African history (more than 21 000 ha were affected \u2013 destroying more than 800 buildings, 5000 ha of forest plantations and claiming the lives of seven people). Investigations reported that its severity was caused by a cocktail of factors, including drought, low atmospheric humidity, strong warm Bergwind conditions and abundant biomass. After the fires, the lack of vegetation cover on steep sandy slopes in the affected areas posed an immediate danger of erosion and landslides to downstream catchments, ravines and man-made infrastructure. Areas with high infestations of invasive alien plants required active re-establishment of indigenous plants and the removal of alien seedlings (popular and aspen) after germination. It is estimated that 53 km of wood fibre rolls (or \u0022sausages\u0022) and 54 000 m\u00b2 of erosion blankets (Woodwool fibre filled) have been installed on post-fire erosion mitigation projects. Furthermore hydroseeding was carried out with the annual grass \u0022teff\u0022 (Eragrostis tef) to serve as an interim (annual grass) soil stabiliser.

It is an optimum choice to help reduce the impacts of climate change. The farmers in Thomacheat Samdach Te Chhor Hun Sen, Sror Aem Commune, Choam Ksant District, Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia previously used the water from ponds for the irrigation of their fields. But this supply was insufficient. In order to resolve the issue, the Cambodia Center for Study and Development in Agriculture (CEDAC) implemented a project and provided a bore hole with a solar powered pump in the commune in 2011 so as to irrigate the crops. In 2014, the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery (PDAFF under the support of the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA Follow up phase 2) gave a set of solar water pump which was implemented in the commune for irrigating also the vegetable fields. They offered the village seven solar water pumps in total. One solar water pump has been installed at the house of Mr. Mao Sarath. The solar panels are portable, as sometime the solar power is variable. \nThe solar pump system consists of solar panels mounted on the top of a wooden structure, a pump motor, a pump inverter, a water storage tank with a supporting structure and electric cables. For its installation, a bore hole firstly needs to be drilled, and a pump needs to be put in place to draw the water from the bore hole and a for water delivery a drip pipe set has to be putted on the vegetable field. Then the supporting structures for two water storage tanks need to be installed which one of 4.8 and one of 2.04 meters in height. After the water storage tanks have been connected with a pump motor. Nine solar panels were fastened on the top of the water tank support construction and a pump inverter has been attached to generate electricity. The water in the tank has to be monitored regularly to secure permanent supply of water. The two water storage tanks have a capacity of 5000 liters which is enough for irrigating the crops and for the consumption of 3 households. Due to this kind of water supply facility the resilience to climate change has been increased and in consequence the emigration has been reduced. More people turned back to the agricultural sector, including farming.\nThe advantages of the technique are that water can be pumped automatically, that it saves labor and time, it does not use fuel, it reduces the CO2 emission, and it can deliver water at a considerable distance. A budget of 2000 USD was left to maintain the solar water pumps before the project has been completed. This budget was managed by the Border Development and Natural Agriculture Community; however, the community could use this budget for example for their members to take out a loan with an interest rate of 2% per month. After one year of the installation of the water pump, Mr. Mao Sarath expected to sell drinking water to other villagers during dry season or drought condition at cost of 1,500 Riel per cubic meter (excluded the 3 mentioned household).  But until now, he was not able to do so due to the fact that other villagers were able to get access to bore holes with pumps and ponds by support of other NGOs too.\nIn short, the solar water pump is an innovation which uses solar energy to power a motor, thereby replacing a fuel powered motor which would have heavy impacts on the environment. The water is used to irrigate crops in the fields as well as for household consumption by the inhabitants of the village. This is to replace the bore holes with pumps in all of the different households, as villagers are now able to just drill one and install a solar powered pump with water storage tanks, and drip irrigation which provides water more easily to each household in the village.COMMENTS:Without any assistance from NGOs, the farmers could not spend their own money to buy solar water pumping due to the high cost.The farmer grew short-term crops such as mango, jack-fruit, eggplant, and luffa gourds.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation|Solar-powered farming systems","type_id":"993, 1188, 1044, 1045","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 918, 920, 910, 914, 909, 925","readiness_level":"7.

Farmer could make compost within different periods, short term, medium term and long term. Compost can already be done in 14 to 18 days and it can be used, but the average maturation is 3-4 months and the long term , it can be used after 5 to 6 months (CEDAC, 2015). \nCompost is made of manure (cow, buffaloes, pigs, poultry), household waste, fresh plant leaves (woody herb, water hyacinth, water lettuce, vegetable or fruit), etc. The compost brings significant benefits, such as: It provides quick nutrients to plants when compared with fresh manure or unburnt fertilizers. In addition, compost fertilizers bring many microorganisms to the soil, and these organisms help soil fertility. It doesn\u0027t exist any plants seed or weed, virus, disease on crop because most of them are killed while the fertilizer is decaying (CEDAC, 2015,YouTube, 2016). \nMr. Mam Mok, the examined farmer of this case study has been practicing this kind of fertilizer since 2008. His compost is made up of ingredients such as rice straw, cow manure, leaves, rice husks, biochar, kitchen waste, water etc. He uses dry compost mainly for his paddy rice fields. \nThe main purposes of making compost are to increase the rice yield and to get healthier produced rice (reduction in chemical fertilizer). Before he used dry compost his rice yield reached an amount of 4 tons per hectare by using a high amount of Urea (5 bags per hectare), now, though, his yield is about 5 to 6 tons per hectare. In addition, chemical fertilizer has been reduced to 1 to 2 bags per hectare. This means that the application of dry compost reduces as well the expenditure for chemical fertilizers. Another advantage is that the land user gets his manure on-site without spending money, as the most part of material can be found for free on his farm or nearby.\nIt is a very good SLM technology to improve soil fertility. The application of dry compost avoids compaction, increases the organic matter in soil, boosts the general activity of micro-organisms, and consequently stimulates the growth of rice plants. Then again, there are also some constraints as the amount of compost is not sufficient to feed the whole area of 1.30 hectares. Therefore, every year the farmer spreads the compost only on about an area of 0.50-0.60 hectares by shifting every year the application area. Moreover, the manufacturing requires labor force, which in the family of Mr. Mam Mok is rather decreasing. The duty consists e.g. of collecting raw material and the daily control over compost stage during the maturation process. At any time he has to control if water has to be added to the raw material. After three month he has to transfer the whole compost, partly decayed, from one basin to another, where final maturation takes place. However, the farmer is satisfied with the technology and because of multiple benefits he does not intend to give it up. \nBefore getting started with compost manufacturing, two compost basins (4 meter in length, 1 m in wide, 1 m in depth) have to be constructed. They are made of bricks, which guarantee a long life cycle. During the rainy season, the farmer uses a tent to cover the basins.\nFollowing steps are necessary to get dry compost: Step 1: A layer of 30 cm of rice straw squashed and mixed with rice husks has to be filled on the bottom of the first basin. After, this mixture needs to be watered sufficiently. Step 3: 20 cm of cow manure has to be put over the first layer. After this, ash from rice husks or from the kitchen waste has to be added. Then it should be watered again. Last step is to bring the already pre-shredded woody herb or leaves (30 cm) on the previous layer. Preparation of layers takes place at the same time. It can be done at any time given, depending nothing but on available raw material and the labor force supporting the manufacturing.COMMENTS:The farmer has 5 cows.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|minimize pesticide use|Farm management|income increase|climate change adaptation|field management","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 909, 922, 926, 910, 1180, 918, 914","readiness_level":"9.

The lift irrigation technology helps to irrigate an afforestation\/agroforestry area (demonstration plot) using surface water (rivers) and solar-powered submersible pump. The construction of reservoirs at the demo plot ensures efficient water storage and use for irrigation purposes without relying on groundwater. A well-designed pipe irrigation scheme is implemented to distribute water evenly across the site, supporting plant irrigation and growth.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Ahmad Khalid WiyarWater exploitation is a critical issue in Afghanistan, and the project aims to address this challenge through innovative and sustainable technology. The technology involves the use of solar panels and submersible water pumps to efficiently lift water from a nearby river to reservoirs constructed uphill, which is then distributed by gravity with the help of a pipe system to irrigate planted saplings in the afforested and agroforestry area. For afforestation, Pinus eldarica (Afghan pine) was planted due to its adaptability and soil stabilization properties. Additionally, citrus and persimmon trees are introduced for agroforestry, combining tree cultivation with agricultural benefits. This integrated technology promotes biodiversity, soil health, and sustainable land use, making the site a model\/ demonstration site for afforestation and agroforestry practices. This is a significant advancement in the local area, utilizing clean energy to promote sustainable land and forest management and environmental restoration. The project is implemented on communal land, covering 50.25 hectares of land.\nThe primary purpose of this technology is to create an efficient irrigation system that extracts and transports water to support afforestation and agroforestry activities. By doing so, it aims to restore forest cover, mitigate environmental challenges such as land degradation, and promote long-term ecological and socio-economic sustainability. The technology includes key components such as solar panels, water pumps (submersible), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes, water reservoirs, and saplings. Additionally, it requires labor, technical assistance, capacity-building programs, and construction materials for its establishment and maintenance.\nThe benefits of this technology are substantial. It has successfully irrigated previously barren land, achieving an impressive 85% survival rate for the saplings that were planted in the plot, while preventing land degradation and improving soil health. Without this technology, survival rates would drop to zero due to the arid conditions. Furthermore, the project has enhanced the capacities of local farmers\/community members, enabling them to replicate and demonstrate the technology within their community. This has fostered a sense of ownership and empowerment among land users.\nLand users have expressed both appreciation and concerns regarding the technology. On the positive side, they value its efficiency and reliability, as the solar panels provide a consistent water supply, especially during the hot\/sunny season, leading to increased greenery and healthier trees. The cost-effectiveness of solar energy, with its low operational costs compared to traditional diesel pumps, has also been a significant advantage. Additionally, the environmentally friendly nature of the technology aligns with their desire for sustainable practices. The capacity-building programs provided by organizations like FAO have further empowered users to manage the system effectively.\nHowever, some challenges have been noted. The initial investment costs for purchasing, installing and construction of the technology are high, making it difficult for smallholder farmers to replicate. Technical issues, such as inverter failures or battery malfunctions during extreme weather conditions (e.g., cloudy weather), can disrupt operations. Additionally, not all community members are equally informed about the technology\u2019s benefits, highlighting the need for increased outreach and engagement efforts to ensure broader adoption and understanding.\nIn summary, this solar-powered irrigation technology represents a groundbreaking innovation in the area, combining clean energy with sustainable land management practices. While it has demonstrated significant environmental and agricultural benefits, addressing the challenges of initial costs, technical reliability, and community engagement will be crucial for its long-term success and scalability.COMMENTS:The area is about 50.25 ha, and the coordinate has been taken from the center of the site, where technology has been implemented:\n34.9419930\u00b0N71.0119714\u00b0ESOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation|Solar-powered farming systems|Mechanization|Digital technologies","type_id":"993, 1044, 1045, 1188, 1015","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|climate change mitigation|water use optimization for sustainability|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"916, 927, 917, 918, 919, 920, 921, 922, 925, 910, 914, 915","readiness_level":"7.

The degree of erosion can be reduced by using structural measures such as lining the banks with concrete or large boulders or by planting trees along the edges. The Salix plant (Salix babylonica) has been found to be particularly useful for preventing erosion because its roots extend deep into the soil and help to anchor the bank. Following age-old tradition, land users in Bhaktapur district have planted Salix along the Bramayaeni khola (stream).

This example of shallow wells is their use in recharge areas to lower groundwater tables. The technology is a subproject of a larger LDD initiative. The technology has been promoted by the Land Development Department at Bua Yai district Nakhon Ratchasima province since 2014. The objectives of the main project are (1) to provide water resources in recharge areas for agriculture: (2) to reduce the amount of saline groundwater and (3) to set up positive economic impact measures.\nThe process of technology establishment comprises 1) a recharge area survey in salt-affected areas, 2) drilling shallow wells to 25-30 meters depth, 3) installing 5.5 hp gasoline pumps and testing water quality, 4) pumping groundwater and distributing it to the cultivated areas.\nShallow well technology has been implemented on the fields of Mr. Boonchu Supho, Ban Nong Mek, Moo 9, T.Dan Chang, A. Buayai, Nakhon Ratchasima Province. Mr. Boonchu Supho has 21 rai (approx. 3.4 hectares), undulating area with a 2-5% slope, situated at approx. 200 meters above sea level, with a tropical climate, and soil which is classified as being in the series of Kula Ronghai (Ki). This area is upland, and located in the recharge area. Mr. Boonchu Supho has 13 rai (approx. 2 hectares) of lowland rice fields and one shallow well.\nIn the past, water scarcity was the main issue with his land. Droughts resulted in water scarcity and low productivity. After excavating a shallow well in 2014, groundwater was used for 19 rai of cultivation. Due to soil salinity reduction, rice yields increased to 590 kg\/rai (approx. 3700 kg\/ha: an increase of approx. 47.4%).  Sugar cane yield increased to 30 ton\/rai. Moreover, land users can use land more efficiently with mixed plantations of banana, pineapples, sweet bamboo, chilies, galangal and lemongrass to generate income. Even with a drought in 2018, his land had enough water for cultivation, while rice fields in the surrounding area faced water scarcity problem.\nIn conclusion, the benefits of the shallow well are 1) lowering the groundwater table and reducing salinity, 2) enhancing rice and sugar cane yields, 3) ability to cultivate throughout the year and 4) better soil properties and a better environment. However, the disadvantage of the shallow well is that farmers have to pay for electricity (around 1,200 THB\/ 9 months or 10,800 THB\/year).COMMENTS:Mr. Boonchu Supho has in total 21 rai, divided into 1) Recharge area, which is located in the upland zone.

It can also be used immediately after the slurry flows out of the biodigester tank. Such fertilizer helps to improve the soil quality in the long-term due to the rich organic matter that it contains which slowly decomposes to plant nutrients.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Nary LayThere are many kinds of biodigesters and the one used in this technology is a 5000 liter plastic cylinder. It was installed by placing part of the tank into the ground and setting up an inlet-outlet pipe as well as a gas pipe system. The whole installation process takes around a day to complete. In order to produce gas initially the biodigester needs about 120 buckets (around 2000 kg) of fresh cow manure and 120 buckets (1200 liters) of water, which then needs to be kept for one week so that it can produce gas and slurry as fertilizer. After that the farmer has to add one bucket (around 20 kg) of fresh cow manure and one bucket (20 liters) of water every day in order to maintain the continuous production of gas and slurry. As a result, the farmer\u2019s family has gas from the biodigester which provides sufficient energy for cooking. In this way they are able to save time which is otherwise spent collecting fuel-wood and it reduces their firewood consumption by around 2190 kg per year. The fresh cow manure for the biodigester should be free from rubbish and not contain small gravel because this blocks the inlet \/outlet of the biodigester tank.\nIn addition, to be able to use the gas for cooking and lighting, the farmer also has the opportunity of using the slurry from the biodigester as fertilizer for all kinds of crops, including bitter gourds, eggplants, mangos, yard long beans, rice, bamboo shoots and other supplementary crops. The slurry from the biodigester can be applied as fertilizer either in a liquid, a semi-dry or a dry form. The slurry can be applied to the crops directly or compost can be made by mixing it with other degradable materials such as woody herb, rice straw and other green leaves. This practice will increase the quantity of the fertilizer because the slurry from bioidigester helps to accelerate the decomposition process and it also produces a higher quality compost.\nThe slurry from biodigester improves soil aggregates and fertility for a longer period than chemical fertilizers. The slurry contains a lot of nutrients specially nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that are necessary for plants, and it does not have an awful smell, or contain weed seeds and parasites. The nutrients are in a chemical form which can easily be absorbed by plants, and it contains vitamin B12 which stimulates the growth of earth worms. The use of slurry enables the growth of various microorganisms and besides earth worms, other useful animals such as frogs and soil-insects, thereby maintaining a natural balance of the environment. The fertilizer enhances the growth of crops, builds resistance to disease, and does not affect the soil and human health. For poorer quality soil, the slurry or compost improves both the physical and biological conditions of the soil. It improves the nutrient content including macronutrients and micronutrients, and also helps to keep soil aggregates and moisture.COMMENTS:National Biodigester Programme installed such biodigester at 6 families in Kouloap commune.Main crops (cash and food crops): Rice, sugar cane, banana, eggplant, bitter gourd, yard long bean, mango and other vegetable.\nRaising of 19 cows to supply manure for the biodigester and also around 100 chickenSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Renewable energy \u0026amp; transportation|Biofuels from agricultural waste","type_id":"993, 1044, 1047","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|optimization of resource use for better production|climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 916, 921, 909, 919, 922","readiness_level":"7.

Dry season rice cultivation is normally prevented by an inadequate water supply. Farmers can usually only practice rain fed rice cultivation. However, in 2012 one land user had an idea so as to maximize the use of his land. He hired a backhoe in order to excavate a pond which he could then use for fish breeding. The pond\u2019s total volume is 1,700 m2 and it measures 50 meters x 30 meters, with a depth of 1.5 meters. A canal had been dug to fill the pond with water from a nearby stream. The pond is utilized for fish breeding, and the water is also diverted for the cultivation of rice in both the dry and wet seasons.  This is done by utilizing small 40 cm wide irrigation canals which were established to supply water to the rice paddies. This technique therefore not only assists agricultural practices but also enables aquaculture  and thus has provided households with increased food security. Furthermore the rice paddies have become more productive throughout the plantation periods. The fishpond also manages to control erosion as it retains the run-off water from the surrounding forest areas. This run off is held by the pond before it reaches the rice fields. Therefore, the technique helps to sustain agricultural activities on the land and reduce localized drought. However, supplying water to areas that are at a higher elevation than the pond remains difficult;  farmers are unable provide sufficient amounts of water without the use of a pump. After adopting this technique land users have been very satisfied with the outputs as they can cultivate rice throughout the year, so in both the dry and the rainy seasons, and as a result have produced higher yields of rice. They have also been able to raise fish which has provided meat for household consumption. This means that the families applying the technique are currently better off.  Additionally, the soil has become moister and this has prevented the  development of clods as had happened in the past. The fishpond is 50 meters long, 30 meters wide and has a depth of 1.5 meters. The water gate, which measures 40cm x 40cm has been constructed with planks.  In the dry season particularly when there is an inadequate amount of water in the rice field, the farmer will open this gate so as to divert water from the pond to the rice fields. They are able to use half of the pond\u2019s volume of water at one time, and then it will gradually have to be filled up again with water that runs through a canal from the stream. It takes a few days to refill the pond and then the farmers are once again able to irrigate their paddies. The pond was established right next the rice paddies which can be fed through a 40 cm wide canal that is blocked by a wooden gate when not in use. Additionally a 5 HP, diesel water pump is used to pump water uphill from the fishpond to another 0.5ha paddy field. This is necessary because the paddy field, on a slope of 3-5% is located at a higher elevation - which is a characteristic feature of rice paddies. The species of fish fingerlings in the pond include tilapia, common carp and grass carp. As the fish are maturing  the land users mostly feed them with rice bran because it is readily available. A plastic net is used as a filter in front of either the pump inlet when irrigating the paddy field upstream or the gate when water is being diverted to the paddy field downstream so as to avoid the loss of fish. The pond has a storage capacity is 2,000 m3 and it is replenished from a natural source by a canal that was recently constructed by the land users. Strengths: (1) Water from the fishpond can be used for rice cultivation in both the dry and rainy seasons, thereby enabling agricultural activities without the provision of water from an irrigation system. (2) It enables fish breeding and therefore land users can propagate various fish fingerlings.

Approximately 60 tons of invasive Prosopis wood are collected weekly, ejecting an estimate of Ksh. 400,000 weekly income to the local community.\nProsopis, the only tree in Baringo permitted for charcoal production is cut by land users and dried for three days to lower its water content before being transported to the production firm. The trees are then weighed and cut into 15 cm lengths, a corresponding dimension of the loading and offloading trolleys. In the carbonizing chambers, the raw materials are subjected to indirect burning and consequent cooling by pyrolysis gas heated at 250 \u2013 500 degree celcius, a process that takes 8-16 hours. Operations in the chambers are controlled and regulated by an assembly of sensors. Ready charcoal is offloaded into a winch which is covered and sealed by a sandy-clay mixture for further cooling to prevent combustion.\nLand users prefer this technology to the traditional one as it is more efficient with a guaranteed income from the sale of Prosopis wood. The carbonization process is fine-tuned, minimizing smoke production and the number of point sources of pollution through household-based traditional charcoal production. A steady production process that is resilient to rainy seasons ensures market readiness and reduces price fluctuations. Clearing the land from invasive Prosopis increases the land\u0027s economic and ecological value and the provision of mutliple ecosystem services relevant for local people.COMMENTS:No precise location, rather indication of area where the technology is being implemented.The cleared lands, unless located within the irrigated farmlands where cultivation usually follows, are usually left idle allowing Prosopis to coppice and the harvesting cycle continues.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Harvesting and processing equipment|Digital technologies|Sensor","type_id":"993, 1188, 1192, 1015, 1036","use_cases":"Production|forest products and logging management|Farm management|income increase|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change mitigation|field management","use_cases_id":"897, 901, 910, 1180, 915, 916, 917, 919, 914","readiness_level":"7.

It consists of planting izote (Yucca sp.) to create a V shaped fence around a gully.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Helen GambonThe Department of Olancho is a rainforest located at 1500 masl in the mountain range regions of Cordillera Central and  Sierra de Agalta. Even though most of the area is protected as a natural reserve or natural park, it suffers from extensive deforestation from livestock practices and intensive industrial forest management practices. However, small land holders also clear forests. This causes rampant forest fires, soil degradation and erosion. The Department of Olancho is frequently affected yearly by tropical storms and hurricanes coming from the Atlantic. This combination of strong natural phenomena, topographic exposure and misuse of natural resources frequently results in significant property damage and even human deaths.\nGullies are formed by intense rain falling on degraded soils and, thus, gullies grow larger with each rainstorm. This increases the risk of land slides and reduces production areas. V shaped catchment fences using izote plants are set in place to control the gully head because they reduce the effective slope of erosion.\nThe izote plant (Yucca sp.) takes root and keeps on growing after being planted. By planting izote (Yucca sp.) in a V shaped pattern throughout the gully, the resulting fence contains the flow of water and sediment, thus increasing water filtration into the ground. Trenches are dug out with a depth of 30-50 cm in a V shape across the gully. The izote plants are cut in pieces 5-10 cm pieces, with an average length of 1.5 meters, depending on the depth of the gully. The plants are placed vertically in the trench, in tight clusters, and then the trench is filled with soil. The length of the fence depends on the width of the gully, an average of 3 meters (1.5 per side). The space between fences varies between 2 and 6 meters, depending on the slope. In time, the catchment fence becomes filled with sediment, thus reducing the speed of water runoff and promoting the accumulation of nutrients. Thus, in time, deep gullies can turn into a series of narrow fertile terraces on which crops may be grown.\nHowever, the catchment fences must be included as part of a comprehensive plan for basin management and protection and, thus, must be supported with other SLM\/RHR measures on the side slopes, such as live fences along the edge.\nCatchment fences must be trimmed once a year so the izote plants don\u2019t grow branches. The upper area where the sediments are collected must be cleared of unwanted material once a month during the winter.\nIn this case study, V shaped catchment fences were implemented through the project \u201cResiliencia\u201d, which is undertaken by the Honduran\/ Swiss Red Cross. This project aims at providing sustainable support to enhance resilience in the rural regions in Olancho, as well as coordinating efforts to reduce risk and to promote health at all levels (home, community, municipality). Bioengineering works are highly vulnerable and exposed to natural disasters.COMMENTS:Main crops (cash and food crops): Banana, yucca (Manihot esculenta)SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Farm management|disaster management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|forestry management|field management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"910, 1154, 916, 921, 918, 927, 914, 917, 920","readiness_level":"7.

It combines the traditional techniques of rainwater harvesting with mechanization for large scale land rehabilitation.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Sabina Galli ValleraniThe Technology mechanizes the traditional technique of zai and semi circular bunds for water harvesting using a modified plow named Delfino3s pulled by a 180hp tractor. A normal plow on flat land excavates a symmetrical, continuous furrow, and earth piles up equally on both sides of the furrow. The Delfino3s plow has a single reversible plowshare that creates an angled furrow and piles up the excavated soil in half moon shaped ridges only on the downhill side. The plowing must be done along the contour to collect and slows down runoff water as it flows downhill. The plow\u2019s blade moves in and out of the soil creating micro basins about 5 meters long, 50 cm deep, 50 cm wide and spaced 2-3 m. The ripper placed before the plow cracks up the soil to a depth of 70 cm facilitating the infiltration of water into the soil profile and the growth of deep roots. After plowing, the local population sows seeds of plants of indigenous species. They are sown along the ridges of the basins and in the furrow of the ripper. While for most species seeds are collected by the local population, for species rarely present in the region, seeds are purchased from tree nurseries. Sowing the manure of goat containing seeds has also been very successful with about 95% of all micro basin having at least one tree growing. The intervention on a big scale, the effects of water infiltration in depth, erosion reduction and vegetation growth, boost a long lasting rehabilitation process. Each day the Delfino plow can plow up to 20 ha, digging 6.000-7.000 micro basins. The speed, the capability to plow hard, abbandoned land, the effectiveness of the Delfino3s plow are its major advantages for the ecosystem rehabilitation process but require a big commitment. To make the best out of it, a great motivation and organizational work is necessary to: find great availability of land; train accuratelly the technicians; have well-rooted Subjects in the region. The technological aspect is just part of the recovery process, an important work with the Communities is required upstream and downstream. Communities are involved in the management process \u2013 in identifying the areas to be restored, clarifying the land uses of the affected areas, planning and implementing e.g. gathering and keeping seeds of local ecotypes, sowing, in the management of plantations and in the monitoring and evaluation of the results. Rules for SLM are adopted and respected by all. The Technology is applied in a degraded agro-sylvo-pastoral area of the Sahel Region, in the north east of Burkina Faso with 200-500 mm of annual rainfall. The soil is sandy-loam, strongly degraded with surface crust. The population is mainly composed of semi-nomadic herders. At the beginning of the project, the NGO Reach Italia was promoting schooling; they soon realized that during the dry season most kids left school and that to avoid it they should face food security and pasture improvement. So they started applying the Vallerani System and developped the participatory approach. The vegetation growth reduces the need for fodder search and long-range transhumance which also allows children to go to school regularly.The ecosystem rehabilitation effect of the technology help the communities to become more concious and resilient to the effects of climate change and prepared to cope with the socio-economic-environmental changes they are faced with.COMMENTS:Since the project is going on since 2002, it is possible to see implemented sites in different stadium of rehabilitation. The plowing lines are clearly visible.\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology in the Region is about 25.600 hectares up to 2017.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Land degradation-desertification with reduction of vegetation cover in terms of plant density and species diversity is the main problem: disappearance of grasses and trees, reduction of the size of the plants that are resistant and of the biological activity of the soil. Runoff, water and wind erosion increase. Drought and irregular precipitation have heavy consequences on soil fertility, availability of water for humans and livestock, and recharging groundwater.\nNumber of growing seasons per year: 1SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Institutional|Governance function|Inclusive decision-making processes in agriculture|Partnerships|Social and socio-economic|Community engagement","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1116, 1129, 1131, 1135, 1076, 1091","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Farm management|field management|disaster management","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 897, 1186, 899, 918, 921, 920, 922, 910, 914, 1154","readiness_level":"9.

First, contour lines are marked on the slope. The tractor follows a contour line, and the plow makes a furrow about 50 cm deep. A normal plow on flat land excavates a symmetrical furrow, and earth piles up equally on both sides of the furrow. The Vallerani plow creates an angled furrow and piles up the excavated soil only on the lower (downhill) side. This soil forms a ridge that stops or slows down runoff water as it flows downhill.\nThe plow can dig a long continuous furrow. Alternatively, as it moves forward, the plow blade can also move up and down (i.e. in and out of the soil), creating a series of small basins, each with a ridge. The size and spacing of basins will depend on the frequency of the up-and-down movement of the plow, which can be adjusted.\nWhen a furrow or pit fills up, the overflow enters the next microcatchment, flows into the next furrow or pit, and so on. Shrubs are planted in pits along the ridges. With moisture readily available, they grow rapidly, providing livestock fodder and helping to conserve the soil. The furrows\/basins also slow down runoff flows, preventing erosion.\nThe Vallerani plow can \u2018treat\u2019 30 ha in a single day, building scores of micro-catchments. For example, the 100-ha Qaryatein site, a highly degraded area at the center of the Syrian traditional grazing ground with 120 mm rainfall per year, was developed in 4 days. Preparation of pits and transplantation of shrubs took another 15 days. Once the project had invested in the tractor and the plow, the remaining cost of implementation \u2013 layout, planting shrubs, training farmers to build and maintain the system \u2013 was about US$1250, i.e. about $13 per hectare.COMMENTS:Future (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Cropland: Ct: Tree and shrub croppingSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Vehicles and machinery|Conservation practices|Nature-based solutions","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1194, 1198, 1196","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|Production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|animal production|Farm management|field management","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 917, 918, 920, 897, 1186, 899, 910, 914","readiness_level":"7.

Here, the application of precision farming and variable rate technology approach has been proposed as a mean to optimize organic amendment inputs in croplands. Automatic application of organic inputs can be a viable way to increase farm efficiency, productivity and finally profitability.\nPurpose of the Technology: Following the natural heterogeneity of the field, precision farming and variable rate technology are here applied as a SLM practice to increase the soil organic carbon (SOC), reduce losses of diffuse polllutants while increasing yield production.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Precision farming is already a feasible and useful technology in terms of automation, data process and management. In this context, site-specific application of mineral nitrogen is one of the most promising techniques to reduce the environmental impacts of nitrogen pollution. In the same way, variable-rate input of organic amendments (manure, slurry, compost etc.) can be useful for increasing the soil fertility. Spatial information of field characteristics can be overlapped with on-the-go sensors information in the field in order to provide the right dose of biosolid input.\nNatural \/ human environment: High efficient organic application systems will provide both environmental and agronomical benefits. Nutrient management will be optimized and the loss in the groundwater will be reduced. Moreover the soil fertility will be improved by the site-specific application of organic matter, providing the best comnbination between organic inputs, nutrient requirements and reduction of nutrient losses.COMMENTS:This is only a potential technology that could be applied in the field. At the moment it is not applied in Veneto region.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soils in the low Venetian plain of the Veneto region generally suffer from a loss of soil organic matter (SOM) that is strongly affected by their natural texture and climatic conditions. Moreover, in the last 50 years intensive tillage practices contributed to a further SOM decrease, estimated at 0.02-0.58 t\/ha\/y of carbon. Finally, high intensive agriculture practices increased nonpoint source pollution and in turn caused a decline of surface and groundwater quality.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): To date, few farmers have adopted voluntarily the continuous soil cover to reduce a decline of soil fertility and water quality, symptom of poor perception of the problem. Adoption of SLT by farmers was sustained only by means of regional subsidies.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Vehicles and machinery|Digital technologies|Sensor|Geospatial technologies|GIS|GPS","type_id":"993, 1188, 1194, 1015, 1036, 1052, 1027, 1028","use_cases":"Production|crop production|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change mitigation|water use optimization for sustainability|reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 908, 909, 910, 914, 916, 921, 922, 919, 920, 925, 917","readiness_level":"4.

Adicionalmente,  puede ser utilizado en la renovaci\u00f3n de pasturas degradadas y en sistemas agroforestales como cultivo de intercalado en los primeros a\u00f1os de establecimiento de especies perenne; lo cual se considera como un recurso fundamental para establecer, renovar o mejorar el tipo y calidad de praderas productivas en los sistemas ganaderos de la regi\u00f3n.\nAcorde a lo anterior, en arreglos de asociaci\u00f3n de arroz y pastos, es importante utilizar una sembradora de dep\u00f3sito, en la que se encuentren separadas las semillas de arroz, las de pasto y el fertilizante. Es recomendable establecer surcos de arroz con intervalos de 34 cm y en medio los surcos de pasto, as\u00ed como aplicar fertilizantes en los surcos de arroz. Si las leguminosas son peque\u00f1as y se siembran en asociaci\u00f3n con pastos, las semillas de las primeras se mezclan con las de pasto en el mismo\nsurco. Si son medianas, se mezclan con semillas grandes, el arroz y el fertilizante. \nLos beneficiarios de la tecnolog\u00eda son son medianos a grandes productores que cuentan con experiencia que les permite asumir los riesgos en inversi\u00f3n, por los cual han mejorado sus procesos administrativos, comerciales y financieros (Fedearroz, 2011).COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Harvesting and processing equipment|Biologicals|Biotechnologies|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)|Nature-based solutions","type_id":"993, 1188, 1192, 2100, 994, 1199, 1196","use_cases":"Production|crop production|animal production|improved plant varieties|precision seeding and fertilization for better production|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 899, 902, 908, 909, 910, 914, 916, 921, 918","readiness_level":"9.

Due to the fact that the village is located on sloping land there are limitations regarding the availability of agricultural land suitable for growing vegetables in a home garden.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Khampheng BounpanyaThe local farmers mainly grow vegetables with other crops such as upland rice in upland areas and vegetable home gardens. In addition, they grow also vegetables along riverbanks during the dry season. Land users living on mountainous areas typically grow vegetables during the wet season and some manage to cultivate them during dry season if appropriate land is available along streams and river banks. Vegetables have traditionally been cultivated by farmers in Darkchung district on terraced fields for many generations. However, growing vegetables on areas of land with a higher gradient (rolling slopes: 11-15%) has a number of restrictions, namely the lack of suitable land available and the limited water supply. As a result of these restrictions on land and water farmers have developed their own initiatives to enable the cultivation of vegetables on sloping land both for household consumption and for sale. The vegetables most commonly grown are coriander, morning glory, and Chinese cabbage and mustard leaf. In 2000 farmers expanded their vegetable gardens on slopes by preparing and cultivating the land manually. Suitable land for such vegetable gardens can be selected along the lower banks of a stream (there should be a distance of approximately 5 \u2013 10 meters from the river to the vegetable plots). Firstly, grass has to be removed prior to ploughing the soil manually. Then the soil from the top part of the land should be transferred to the bottom to result in a levelling effect so that a relatively flat garden bed is created. The preparation process to develop the whole garden takes about 3 \u2013 4 weeks and requires a team of two to three people. In the preparation process there is a distinctive drawback when the farmers remove the humus and topsoil from the upper section of the field and leave the less fertile subsoil behind. As a result, this might affect the productivity during the early stage of vegetable growth; and on the contrary the lower sections piled with nutritious topsoil from the upper parts become more suitable for plant growth. To solve this problem, the farmers shape and level the nutrient-rich topsoil up to 3-4 small terraces top down. On average, with an area of 0.01ha such vegetable fields in Darkchung district are divided into small terraces with a width of 60 \u2013 80 centimetres and a length of 2 \u2013 3 metres (about 7 \u2013 8 terraced plots per household, mostly two terrace arrangements in parallel). There is approximately a 30 cm difference between the levels of the upper to the next lower vegetable terrace. Once the land levelling has been completed, the farmers are then able to prepare the plots by firstly ploughing the soil and then letting it dry for 5 \u2013 7 days. The next stage involves the use of wooden poles to break down bigger clods of earth. Then a small earth dike (10cm in hight) is pilled up around each terrace to protect furhter against soil erosion by water. Before starting the vegetable cultivation fencing is needed against animal entry. After this, they use a rake to adjust the plot\u2019s surface. The benefits of this terracing method is to extend the cultivation of vegetables on stream river banks for the household consumption. Futhermore, the terracing method and the better soil cover lead to protection of the stream banks from erosion and sediment transport. However, this technique have some constraints as well beause it is difficult to level the surface of the soil in these areas particularly by removing soil from the upper sections to the lower sections of the terraces.COMMENTS:Main crops: Chinese mustard and cabbageSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation|Low-cost farming tools and techniques","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1206, 1076, 1088, 1089","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 921, 920, 917, 918, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

It is a sustainable farming technique that optimizes land use, increases agrobiodiversity, diversifies production, and enhances overall yields.  Land users in Yusipang grow peas, beans, and cole crops (cabbages, kale, etc.) in their apple orchards.\nIntercropping vegetables in orchard land optimizes the use of space, sunlight, water and nutrients. Intercropping also increases biodiversity within the orchard ecosystem. This coexistence of species reduces the vulnerability of the orchard to crop failure and pest infestation: it improves the residence of the overall system.\nTrees in the system absorb nutrients from the soil and return them through fallen leaves, thereby improving soil fertility and reducing reliance on external fertilizers. This nutrient recycling improves the overall health of the orchard ecosystem. Intercropping can also help in natural pest management through various mechanisms \u2013 including the attraction of beneficial insects - thus reducing the need for chemical pesticides.  It also fosters a beneficial microclimate.\nTo establish intercropping of vegetables in orchards, careful planning and design is required with respect to crop selection, spacing of trees and intercrops, irrigation, and nutrient management. Regular weeding and mulching are required alongside adequate irrigation, integrated pest management, and pruning of fruit trees to prevent competition for light and space.\nIntercropping of vegetables in orchards thus offers multiple benefits to farmers and the overall agricultural system, including increased farm productivity.  It increases climate resilience and improves the health of the agroecosystem. However, it is important to be aware of potential drawbacks. These include competition between crops for resources - and labour. Sound management practices can overcome these challenges and maximize the effectiveness of intercropping.COMMENTS:The area does not fall under any protected area or parks.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Species diversification|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1200, 1197, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|optimization of resource use for better production|Farm management|field management|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|minimize pesticide use|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 917, 909, 910, 914, 921, 918, 926, 920","readiness_level":"7.

It is extensively practiced in the Municipalities of Atok, Buguias, Mankayan, Kibungan, Bakun, Kabayan in Benguet; Bauko in Mountain Province and Tinoc in Ifugao. Benguet is known as the \u0022Salad Bowl of the Philippines\u0022 and major producer of temperate vegetables. This is mainly due to the climatic condition of the province which is suitable for vegetable production.Vegetable industry in Benguet is very vital in the country since it supplies 60-70% of the total sub-tropical vegetables in the Philippines. Major vegetable crops grown are potato, cabbage, chinese cabbage, carrots, chayote, beans, lettuce and broccoli. These are sold to traders, consolidators, wholesalers who transport the produce at the La Trinidad Vegetable Trading Post or other local markets in the region.\nPurpose of the Technology: Available arable lands are not expanding but the population is increasing. This situation contributes to the conversion of sloping areas to a suitable land for agricultural production,thus, the technology was developed. This had become an economic practicality to the land user as source of livelihood and income. Vegetable terracing is also a conservation measure to minimize soil degradation by varying the terrace type and plot orientation. Some follow the contour while other plots are parallel to the slopes.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Prior to terrace establishment, vegetation is partly removed. Residues are cleared for the establishment of the contour lines of the area. From the established contour lines, terraces will be graded and leveled depending on the slope of the area. Most of these activities are done manually. After the establishment of the terraces, land preparation is done followed by planting of the vegetables.\nNatural \/ human environment: The area is under humid agro-climate condition with an average annual rainfall of approximately 1000-1500 mm per year.

In the Veneto region they are generally used along streams, canals and roads and can be composed of grass, hedges, trees or their combination. Buffer strips were a major component of agricultural landscape that has been replaced by intensive monoculture practices by increasing tillable areas. In recent years, the re-introduction of buffer zones in the Venetian plain (and generally in the whole territory of the region) has been supported as an agri-environmental measure for a sustainable land management.\nPurpose of the Technology: Vegetated buffer strips, recently promoted by the regional government, are an efficient and economical way to improve surface water quality by agricultural nonpoint source pollution. Farmers take advantage of using buffer strips to help control soil erosion and sediment loss, stabilize riverbanks and reduce flood damage to crops. The continuous soil cover and diversification of habitats improve agroecosystem biodiversity and diversification of farmers income.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Vegetated buffer strips are generally composed of a shrub or tree belt of 1 m combined with an herbaceous band of 5 m, usually placed on the sides of cultivated fields in order to maximise their depuration efficacy as well as  ensure crop production. Their function to reduce water pollution is optimal if arranged along a water course in order to intercept suspended solids and sediment-bound nutrients.\nNatural \/ human environment: Adopting vegetated buffer strips achieves several environmental benefits with a low initial economic investment. The agroecosystem biodiversity is improved by the creation of continuous buffers that provide food, nesting cover, shaded environment and connecting corridors from one habitat to another to wildlife species, while the continuous soil cover with herbaceous and woody plants enhances soil protection and below-ground  biodiversity. Water resources benefit from reduced nutrient supply and sediments that cause excessive growth of algae and diminish oxygen level of the water. Vegetated buffer strips, thanks to the maintenance and differentiation of species in the territory, enhance the quality of life through the improvement of agricultural landscape.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Soils in the low Venetian plain of the Veneto region generally suffer from a loss of soil organic matter (SOM) that is strongly affected by their natural texture and climatic conditions. Moreover, in the last 50 years intensive tillage practices contributed to a further SOM decrease, estimated at 0.02-0.58 t\/ha\/y of carbon. The introduction of monoculture worsened the agro-ecosystem habitats and reduced soil biodiversity.\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Decrease of productivity and the need of higher inputs of fertiliser.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Species diversification","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1200","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|income increase","use_cases_id":"916, 917, 921, 920, 922, 918, 897, 898, 910, 914, 915, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

Another terrace is created directly downslope to form a cascade of terraces. Terrace risers have to be of restricted height (~50-150 cm) to prevent steep and unstable terraces. Stones from the fields can be used to reinforce the terrace ridge. After terrace construction, fields should be gently sloping (~30%) throughout the year (e.g. Stipa tenacisima, Rosmarinus officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, Ulex parviflorus, Rhamnus lycioides, Pistacia lentiscus). Natural regeneration of vegetation is allowed without limitation on the terrace ridges, so no herbicide application or burning are carried out to remove weeds. Where possible, regeneration should be stimulated by planting the same adapted species in at least 25% of the terrace ridge. Optionally, in the other 75% of the terrace ridge, cereals or other leguminous species can be sown, but should not be harvested or used for grazing.\nPurpose of the Technology: This technology reduces flooding, damage to infrastructure and siltation of water reservoirs, while maintaining (or slightly increasing) crop productivity. This is achieved by reducing runoff, soil erosion and hydraulic connectivity through a decreased slope gradient and an increased vegetation cover. The terrace ridge functions as a sink for runoff within fields and reduces runoff velocity. The vegetation leads to increased soil organic matter content below plants, producing an improved soil structure and a higher infiltration capacity. The use of stones from the fields to reinforce the terraces is optional, but facilitates crop production in the fields and makes the ridges more resistant to higher runoff velocities. The technology requires an initial investment in the construction of the terraces. Terraces can best be located on thalwegs and on areas where gully formation is often observed. Maintenance consists of filling up possible bank gullies developed in the terraces after important rainfall events and, if needed, substitute decayed shrubs with new ones.\nNatural \/ human environment: The technology is generally applied on soils of shallow to medium depth (20 \u2013 60 cm), and slopes are gentle to moderate (5-15%). The climate is semi-arid with a mean annual rainfall around 300 mm. Droughts, peaking in summer commonly last for more than 4-5 months. Annual potential evapotranspiration rates larger than 1000 mm are common. The production system is highly mechanized and market-oriented but depends strongly on agricultural subsidies.

It is practiced in areas where there is excess runoff to be disposed and where there is no stones available for construction. The design specifications (ditch gradient, width and height) and layout (spacing\/vertical interval) vary on the amount of excess runoff and slope of the land. Soil bund construction begins from top of the catchment. Cut off drains are constructed on top of the catchment and where needed to drain excess runoff to well stabilized natural or man-made waterways. this helps to reduce runoff impact on gullies. The bund ditch\/channel should be sufficient enough to drain excess runoff safely without causing channel erosion and creating downstream damages. At same time the embankment should be stable to withstand overflows and damage due to free grazing. One technique to stabilize bunds is to plant the embankment with grass and shrub species of multiple economic value in order to compensate production area lost by bund construction. Often, the species are preferably used for livestock feed. Thus, free grazing has to be controlled. To protect damage of channels and embankments by extreme runoff and floods, frequent supervision and maintenance is required.\nThe purposes are:\n1) Reduce nutrient loss and soil erosion by shortening the slope length,\n2) Safely drain excess runoff from upstream of gully into protected waterways,\n4) Produce biomass of fodder and cash values.\nVegetated graded bunds are established by doing surveying using hand level to determine the layout of the technology along the slope. During the surveying, the position of bunds (spacing) and cutoff drains and connection to waterways are determined. Bunds are laid following 0.05% gradient and up to 80 m maximum length. The specifications of the structure are: height of bund is a minimum of 60 cm after compaction; depending on the soil, base width range between 1.0 and 1.5m; top width is between 30 and 50 cm.  The construction is made across different parcels owned by different land users. If there is no natural waterways and where it is appropriate, paved waterways are constructed at every 80 m or less bund length to dispose drainage water. At the beginning of the rainy season, the embankments are covered with grass and\/or shrubs either by direct sowing of seeds or planting the seedlings raised in the nurseries. Monitoring of damages due to flooding and animals, maintenance of the structure as well as replanting of dead seedlings on bunds is required to sustain the soil conservation technology.\nThe technology is appropriately applied in high rainfall and sub-humid areas of the sub-tropics, particularly where the soil is moderately deep and poorly drained. It is constructed on cultivated lands having slopes in the range of 3-15%.  The practice can be constructed by land users. It also requires collective decision and actions to drain excess runoff through waterways. The living condition depends on subsistence crop-livestock mixed farming. On average households have 5-6 family size. Crop production is meant for home consumption with small surplus for local market. The services related to water supply, energy supply, and infrastructure are low. Besides it is an asset, animals often used to cope shocks during drought periods.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 20 km2.\nThe technology is applied on specific conditions within the watersheds or area of adoptionMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Land degradation due to sheet erosion, rills and gullies, soil nutrient depletion, overgrazing, shortage of fuel wood, excessive removal of crop residuals, loss of vegetation and deforestation\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): Soil erosion, soil nutrient depletion, shortage of pastureSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|Production|crop production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|Farm management|field management|disaster management","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 922, 917, 918, 920, 897, 898, 899, 1186, 910, 914, 1154","readiness_level":"7.

They act as soil and water conservation measures to reduce runoff velocity and consequently prevent soil loss. The strips are mostly between 0.3 m and 1.5 m wide and consist initially of one or two rows of plants. They slow down the speed of runoff during heavy rainfall. This facilitates infiltration, and eroded sediment in the runoff is trapped on the upslope side of the barriers. Hence, they contribute to the conservation of soil, water, and plant nutrients. The most used plants\/ crops used in establishing vegetative cross-slope barriers are perennial erect grasses, including Brachiaria sp., napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), and vetiver grass (Vetiver zizanioides). Depending on species (vetiver being an exception), vegetative cross-slope barriers can serve as important sources of fodder for livestock. Some farmers prefer to establish crops (e.g., bananas and pineapples) or trees and shrubs (e.g., (e.g., Calliandra calothyrus, Grevillea robusta or Sesbania sesban) as cross-slope barriers at appropriate spacing (depending on the tree\/ shrub) to serve as windbreakers as well as providing additional measures to control soil erosion. Alternatively, these may be combined with grasses. These can also serve as important sources of food, fodder, fuel, and timber.\nIn establishing vegetative cross-slope barriers, the distance between the barriers is dictated by the slope of the land. The ProSoil project through Welthungerhilfe trained Community Resource Persons (CRPs) on how to survey contours using a line level. The CRPs by extension train farmers on how to measure slope for their fields and how to determine the distance between the barriers using a predetermined scale. Once established, minimal labour is required for maintenance. The main vegetation (grasses) must be harvested or cut back to a height of less than 0.5 m before planting a crop in the main field to prevent them from suppressing the crops through shading. The trees, and shrubs may need to be trimmed (coppiced) during the cropping period to allow adequate sunlight to reach the crops. The cut material can be collected and used as fodder or firewood as appropriate or be incorporated during land preparation, or during weeding as mulch. \nFarmers like the technology because it contributes to soil, water, and nutrient conservation and it reduces the steepness of the slope as soil eroded from the upper part of the slope accumulates on the upslope side of the barrier resulting, eventually, in distinct terrace-like benches. As a result, farmers find it easier to cultivate on these terraces. Vegetative cross-slope barriers can be associated with retention ditches, especially where farmers find it important to harvest the water. They can also provide firewood and fodder, especially where palatable cut and carry varieties of grass are used.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|animal production|optimization of resource use for better production|income increase|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 922, 918, 920, 897, 898, 910, 914, 899, 909, 1180, 917, 912","readiness_level":"7.

Vermicomposting, or worm composting is a simple technology that takes advantage of this to convert biodegradable waste into organic manure with the help of earthworms (the red worm Eisenia foetida) with no pile turning, no smell, and fast production of compost. The earthworms are bred in a mix of cow dung, soil, and agricultural residues or predecomposed leaf-litter. The whole mass is converted into casts or vermicompost, which can be used as a fertilizer on all types of plants in vegetable beds, landscaping areas, or lawns.\nPurpose of the Technology: Worms are so effective at processing organic waste that they can digest almost half their own weight in debris every day. Vermicomposting is a simple composting process that takes advantage of what earthworms do naturally, but confines the worms to bins making it easier for farmers to feed them and to harvest their nutrient-rich compost. Since all worms digest organic matter, in principle, any type of worm can be used; however, not all are equally well adapted to living in bins since some worms prefer to live deep in the soil while others are better adapted to living closer to the surface. The red worm (Eisenia foetida) is ideal for vermicomposting because its natural habitat is close to the surface and it is accustomed to a diet rich in organic matter, this makes it ideally suited to digesting kitchen scraps and to living in bins.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Vermicomposting can be carried out in different types of containers. There are only a few requirements for a good worm pit, the most important being good ventilation; the pit needs to have more surface area than depth (wide and shallow) and it needs to have relatively low sides. The base of the worm pit is prepared with a layer of sand then alternating layers of shredded dry cow dung and degradable dry biomass and soil are added. Under ideal conditions, 1,000 earthworms can covert 45 kg of wet biomass per week into about 25 kg of vermicompost.\nNatural \/ human environment: Worm castings contain five times more nitrogen, seven times more phosphorous, and eleven times more potassium than ordinary soil, the main minerals needed for plant growth. The vermicompost is so rich in nutrients that it should be mixed 1:4 with soil for plants to be grown in pots and containers. Vermicompost should not be allowed to dry out before using.\nNote: This type of vermicomposting is sometimes referred to as \u0027Pusa\u0027 vermicomposting because it was popularized in South Asia by the Rajendra Agricultural University located in Pusa, Bihar, India.COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Crop productivity is limited by poor soil fertility, intense cropping, and a scarcity of irrigation water. Farmers notice a marked decrease in the health of their crops and degraded soil conditions when chemical fertilizers are overused.

It is a form of humus and is produced through worms digesting and excreting organic in their casts. Vermicompost has been shown to be an effective organic soil amendment, reducing the need for inorganic fertilizers.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  GERBA LETAVermicomposting is the process by which worms convert organic materials (usually wastes) into a humus-like material known as vermicompost. The process is an aerobic, bio-oxidation, non-thermophilic process of organic decomposition that depends upon earthworms to fragment, mix and promote microbial activity. In making vermicompost, earthworms are very good at transforming dead plant material, and livestock droppings into excellent manure. The excrement of the worms has high nutrient levels and a growth\u2010promoting effect on plants. Earthworms are very sensitive to changes in moisture and temperature. They need a continuous food supply and protection from ants, birds, and chickens. Compared to ordinary compost making, it needs maximum care. For optimum management practices, vermicompost production must be located close to the homestead where livestock barns are usually located. Livestock droppings (especially those of horses and donkeys) are the best sources of feed in addition to plant biomass and other household refuses. Vermicompost production needs a bin in which the worms live. This holds the bedding and food scraps, regulates the amount of moisture and temperature in the bedding, and blocks light which is harmful to the nocturnal worms. Worm bins can be made from plastic or wooden materials. In Ethiopia, wooden boxes are preferred because they are more absorbent and provide better insulation.\nVermicompost reduces farmers\u2019 investment costs on chemical fertilizers. It also has a sustainable role in restoring soil fertility, ameliorating soil acidity and rehabilitating degraded farmland \u2013 all of which are problems in the southwestern part of Ethiopia. In the farm where vermicompost is applied, newly transplanted seedlings, in the case of vegetables, remain green and resilient as the compost improves not only the nutrients but also the moisture content of the soil. According to the land users, annual and perennial crops such as horse beans (Vicia faba), wheat, cabbages and avocados grown under vermicompost do very well. Under ideal conditions, 1,000 earthworms can convert 45kg of wet biomass per week into about 25kg of vermicompost. Therefore, the size of production depends on the number of worms, supply of foods, availability of boxes, and associated management practices. In rows and spot application of vermicompost during planting the crop allows efficient and effective uses of the products.  \nCurrently (2023) the government in the southwestern zones of Oromia Region is promoting vermicompost as a vital organic fertilizer. This signals a change in the public sector\u0027s and end-users\u2019 mindset in the use of organic fertilizer as a reliable soil amendment, particularly in acid-prone areas. In general, compost restores soil fertility, increases crop production and improves the livelihood of the end users. While the initial cost of constructing the house and installing bins and worms is high, there is potential for the use of local materials. However, it demands considerable household labour for upkeep.COMMENTS:The technology is located close to the home.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biologicals|Biotechnologies|Biofertilizers and biopesticides|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Policy","type_id":"993, 2100, 994, 1001, 1196, 1206, 1095","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|optimization of resource use for better production|climate change adaptation","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 897, 898, 922, 909, 918","readiness_level":"7.

The structure itself can be made by cutting a 60 cm radius and 120 cm height drum into two halves lengthwise. The half to be used must be thoroughly cleaned of oil or chemical residue. A hole is drilled at one end of the half drum for the installation of a tap. A base is made using wooden rails fastened on wooden posts using nails. The container is angled at 30\u00b0 with the outlet pipe or tap on the lower side to allow free flow of leachate\/ vermijuice.

The worms and casts are introduced and evenly spread on the food. A bucket is placed at the outlet to collect drops of vermijuice.\nBedding materials include maize cobs, chopped maize straw, agroforestry tree bark, husks, old cartons and paper, and sugarcane bagasse. Temperature and humidity are checked by a thermometer and a hydrometer respectively. However, temperature can be checked by hand also. It is advisable that food (waste) is decomposed before being added onto the bedding material to maintain the temperature within the desired range of 15 - 20\u00b0C. Worms coil at the top of the material whenever temperatures go higher. Humidity is often higher in culture bins than in composting beds. Hence, more leachate in culture bins than in composting beds. However, humidity content in both culture bins and composting beds should not exceed 60% since the worms can take in a lot of water and die.\nFeeding of the worms is done every 2 weeks where a mixture of 1 kg of chopped fresh tithonia, 3 kg of fresh cow dung, and 3 kg of cooked maize meal (\u201cugali\u201d) is added and evenly spread on the decomposing material.

The worm-free compost on the upper part is completely removed to be used as manure. The remaining material containing the worms is spread uniformly in the half drum. Worm food is then added evenly spread on top.\nThe system described above produces about 30 kg of ready-to-use compost and about 10 litres of vermijuice in 3 months. Provided that all inputs are available, a farmer can produce vermicompost and vermijuice 4 times from the same system in a year i.e., 40 litres of vermijuice and 120 kgs of ready-to-use compost in a year. Normally, a one-acre (0.4ha) farm requires about 20 tonnes of compost for planting maize. Vermijuice is mixed with water in the ratio of 1 part of vermijuice to 10 parts of water when required as a folia fertilizer and in the ratio of 1 part of vermijuice to 5 parts of water when required as a pesticide. 20 \u2013 30 litres of vermijuice can be applied to a 0.4 ha farm.

Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides), which had been growing naturally on the farm for years in isolated clumps, began to be used in 1989 to form vegetative hedges along the contour.\nThe purpose of these hedges is to protect the land from surface erosion by creating semi-permeable barriers, allowing excess runoff to filter through but holding back sediment. Infiltration is thus increased and moisture conserved in-situ. Although sugar cane in itself protects the soil quite well when the canopy is closed, after harvest on  the moderate to steep slopes (10% to \u003E30%) and erodible soils of the north coast of Kwa-Zulu Natal, extra protection is required. The vetiver system is supplemented by other soil conservation measures such as strip cropping, terraces, mulching and minimum tillage \u2013 all of which are used to some extent on this farm. Vetiver also helps by permanently marking the contour line, which then guides land preparation. In common with other vegetative barriers, vetiver lines lead to the formation of terraces over time, through the effect of tillage and water erosion between the strips.\nVetiver clumps are dug up and separated into slips (tillers), cut to a length of 10 cm and then planted 10\u201315 cm apart along the contour, also by stream banks, and by roadsides, just before the rains. This ensures good establishment. Single lines are used in this farm, though double lines are more effective at creating a hedge, and are the normal recommendation. Work starts at the top of the slope, and continues downwards. The cross-slope grass hedges are sited at 5 m vertical intervals on slopes of more than 10%, in lines about 200 m long. The cost of vetiver grass planting depends very much on slope (and thus the number of lines to be planted), availability of materials and labour.\nMaintenance is very important, as vetiver often requires \u2018gapping-up\u2019 to keep the barrier dense, and it needs also to be cut back before the dry season to prevent it burning. The cut material can be used for mulching. Vetiver is poorly palatable, and therefore not useful as fodder. The maximum height of a vetiver hedge is kept down to approximately 50 cm. This minimises shading and competition, keeps the fire risk low, increases tillering (for production of vegetative splits) and ensures adequate density.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 8 km2.\nThe vetiver system has been applied on my own properties.

The system includes a stilling basin, which receives water from a mobile motor pump, a main channel, secondary channels and irrigation ditches. The scheme gives total control over the water available in the area, using a motor pump to move it around the system. The channels are open earth, and stretches where infiltration is high are lined with riprap. The structures are made of concrete. Village irrigation schemes require a source of water, and are therefore generally located along rivers or near permanent bodies of water.\nIrrigation systems of this kind were constructed in Mali after the droughts in the 1970s under numerous development projects implemented to increase rice and wheat production. Between 1996 and 2010, for example, the IPRODI project established 450 irrigation schemes in northern Mali, creating an irrigated area of over 13,000 ha farmed by 55,000 farmers.\nThe water is pumped into the stilling basin and driven by the force of gravity into the main channel and the secondary and tertiary channels to the plots of individual users. Village irrigation schemes are an effective means of expanding the area of irrigated farmland and increasing production. As they permit the total control of the water available, farmers are practically unaffected by variations in rainfall, as long as the water source remains available. They therefore guarantee the production of food crops and straw for livestock. Village irrigation schemes create new irrigated farmland, which enable farmers to achieve high rice yields: around 6 tonnes per hectare. With an average price of 125 CFA francs a kilo for paddy rice, the value of output per hectare is around 750,000 CFA francs. Profit is estimated at around 300,000 CFA francs per hectare. At some sites, a second harvest is possible. Other plots are used for market gardening, with the production of onions, tomatoes, herbs, spices, etc. After the crops have been harvested, animals are allowed to graze on the plots.\nThe process to select an area to be developed begins with a request submitted by the community through the commune authorities. A feasibility study is conducted to determine potentially viable sites. The final choice is made in consultation with the regional and commune authorities and the villages concerned and in accordance with the financial resources available. The highly labour intensive approach is used, with beneficiaries participating in the construction work. The beneficiaries receive support from a project to plan and construct the irrigation system, purchase and install the pumping units (with financial contribution), purchase the tools and establish a start-up fund for the first season. Two technicians are trained per scheme. The village irrigation systems are operated and maintained by the beneficiaries and their management committee. The management committee must set up an operating and maintenance fund to purchase fuel and carry out any repairs. Farmers are required to pay a charge of seven sacks of paddy rice (around a third of their harvest) into the fund. In this way, the pumping units can be replaced after a number of years.\nThose who participated in the construction work are given preference when the plots are distributed among the village\u2019s families. A quarter-of-a-hectare plot is assigned to each \u2018able-bodied person\u2019 who participated in the work to construct the system. The total area assigned to each family therefore depends on the number of able-bodied people in the household. Once the system is in operation, technical services provide support to farmers for a time to teach them adapted farming practices.COMMENTS:Between 1996 and 2010, for example, the IPRODI project established 450 irrigation schemes in northern Mali, creating an irrigated area of over 13,000 ha farmed by 55,000 farmers.

Using a relatively simple development concept, it was possible to create production units that were built and managed by local people in areas seriously affected by drought and a sharp decline in inundation events in the 1970s and 80s. Instead of being dependent on food aid, local people operating a VIS were able to guarantee sufficient rice production to cover their village\u2019s food needs. With one pumping facility and one canal network installed, it is possible to control the water supply for an area of at least 20 hectares, thus creating the required conditions for intensive rice growing.\nPrior to the installation of the scheme, the sites are not suitable for rice growing. Yields significantly increase as a result of the work carried out. An average harvest of six tonnes per hectare increases incomes. With an average price of 125 CFA francs per kilo of paddy, the rate of sales reaches 750,000 CFA francs per hectare. The surplus per hectare is estimated at 300,000 CFA francs.\nA VIS comprises a pumping station, small-scale facilities infrastructure, and irrigation and drainage networks. The pumping station consists of a pump unit fitted with a diesel motor with two or three 28 to 38 horse-power cylinders and a centrifugal pump with a capacity of 350 to 480 cubic metres per hour. The pump is positioned right alongside the water source (river, lake) and is mounted on a mobile chassis so it can be repositioned as and when required\nand depending on the situation of the water source, which can vary considerably during the winter growing season. At the end of the growing season, the pump unit can be stored in a secure, weather-proof location (out of the sun, rain, etc.). Water is then pumped through a flexible hose of reinforced polyethylene (the lengths generally being multiples of 50 metres, but no longer than 150 metres) up into the delivery basin where the energy carried in the turbulent pumped water is dissipated to prevent erosion damage and where the flow is calmed from turbulent to laminar. From the delivery basin onwards, the system makes use of gravity to feed its open canal network. The majority of the network is comprised of earthen structures, with only a section of the main canal being lined (usually a length of between 150 to 300 metres leading from the delivery basin outflow). The secondary and\/or tertiary canals are supplied with water through a division box that apportions supply using a system of (\u2018all or nothing\u2019) gates. Plots are watered from the tertiary canal by turning on the PVC hose.\nInitially, villagers are able to express their need for a VIS through a village diagnostic exercise. This installation request is then taken up by the communes\u2019 PDESC. A formal request is then referred to the mayor and drawn up by the community. The support structure (PMN\/IPRODI) reviews the request and carries out a preliminary feasibility study. Decisions are then taken in a planning workshop on which schemes to prioritise. Following this, private planning consultants are commissioned to conduct feasibility studies. In parallel, technical and financial analyses are carried out by the programme\u2019s planners, who also validate the studies. A meeting is held to inform and raise the awareness of the beneficiary communities about the development approach. The community is then requested to contribute their labour as part of the HLIW measures. The financial contribution required for the pump unit is up to 30% of its cost.\nFarming a VIS (intensive rice growing) is fundamentally different to other, more traditional production systems to which farmers are accustomed (extensive rice growing in floodplains and millet growing in non-flooded areas). VISs require the purchase of inputs and the sale of at least part of the produce. Farming a VIS requires the development and good functioning of a value chain with many more links upstream and downstream of production and beyond the confines of the village than would be found in a traditional system. Although the VIS was initially conceived as a drought response mechanism in the 1970 and 80s, VIS farming encourages farmers to become more integrated in the rural and regional economy.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.4 km2.\nFive communes in the Mopti region and 38 communes in the Timbuktu region.\nInstallation of 489 VISs in at least 43 communes.

This should only be done once the vines are at least 4-5 years old because if done earlier, competition for water can negatively impact growth of the young vines. During the first years certain weeds are removed manually or through the targeted local application of herbicides. After a diverse grass cover has developed no herbicides are used in the vineyard anymore. There is no additional mulching applied, however, all the leaves and branches shed by the vines are left in the plot to decay and to replenish soil organic matter. In addition, the skins of grapes that remain after pressing are spread out on the plot as an organic fertilizer. In terms of inorganic fertilizers, potassium and magnesium are regularly applied to the vines. In some cases also nitrogen has to be applied because of competition for nitrogen between the vines and the grass cover, but this is avoided if possible. Wine quality can suffer from nitrogen insufficiency as it is needed for the fermentation process. Irrigation via a sprinkler irrigation system installed in the plot is only used during the establishment of the young vines. Later, no irrigation is used any more.\nPurpose of the Technology: The main purpose of this technology is to reduce the use of herbicides, to improve soil structure and to promote an increase in biodiversity. A positive impact on reduced evaporation could not be confirmed by the land user as according to him, competition between the grasses and the vines for soil moisture is high. From the researcher\u2019s point of view, the longer roots of the vines compared to those of the grasses should allow the vines to take up moisture from deeper layers and therefore the grass cover should at least have some positive effect on soil moisture. As soil erosion is not an important issue in this area, contrary to other vine producing areas in Switzerland, soil stabilisation is not a major purpose of this technology. However, the grass cover is naturally contributing to soil stabilisation which might still have a positive effect in the case of heavy rainfall events.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The choice of the plot on which grass cover should be established requires very high knowledge of its condition as on very dry soil there will be increase competition for water. Establishment activities are quite simple as the establishment of the grass cover is completely natural with no seeds added by the land user. Only during the first years of establishment, if needed, some contact herbicides are applied locally to prevent very common and aggressively spreading plants such as the dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) to spread and to impede the establishment of more rare species. In terms of maintenance the grass cover has to be cut. The frequency of cutting depends on the weather but is generally done about every 4-6 weeks. Cutting is alternating between lines in order to always retain seeds for reproduction within the system.  The cutting is alternated between rows so that there is always a well-developed cover in at least part of the vineyard. Grass cutting is mechanised with specialised machinery needed to fit in between the vine rows. Because of the need for cutting this technology requires more labour than the common system used for vine cultivation (application of herbicides).\nNatural \/ human environment: The hamlet of Valencon is situated on the right side of the Rhone River, in the central part of the Canton of Valais, in South-western Switzerland. The vineyard is located on a south facing slope at an altitude of about 700 m.a.s.l. The climate in the Rhone Valley is the driest in the whole of Switzerland with only about 500 mm of annual rainfall.\nBecause of increased labour need the farmer transfers the increased investment onto the price per bottle of vine. This is possible because the whole transformation process including sale takes place on farm. His mainly private customers are willing to pay a price premium for integrated production using less herbicides.\nAlthough the interviewed land user is aware of around 10 other land users that have applied the technology, the spread of this technology is limited by the difficult topography which does not allow for mechanization in every case. It is also limited by conservative views about what a proper vineyard should look like (no grass in between the vines).COMMENTS:Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): water scarcity, semi-arid zone, steep slopes, soils have relatively low water holding capacity, use of pesticides\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): mechanization difficult due to topography, decrease of plant biodiversity, use of pesticidesSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Integrated management systems|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1196, 1198, 1197, 1206, 1076","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|minimize pesticide use|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|improving soil management practices|Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production","use_cases_id":"916, 926, 917, 921, 897, 898, 910, 914, 909","readiness_level":"7.

This technology was mainly found in environments of the before mentioned climatic conditions on hilly areas  (slope: 11-30%) and in shallow (depth: 21-50 cm) or moderately deep soils (depth: 51-80 cm) cultivated with perennial crops. These soils present moderate concentrations of soil organic matter (1-3%) and do not face any flood or salinity problems. The socioeconomic environment of these areas is characterized by middle-aged or elderly producers who mainly cultivate leased medium-sized fields with mechanical equipment. The orientation of the market is mixed (subsistence\/commercial) and the off farm income of producers is greater than 50% of their total income.\nThe main characteristics of the technology is the presence of an adequate amount of rock fragments especially on the soil surface. Rock fragments are found, in many cases, in the soil. Farmers used to remove them for clearing the soil but in case that the area is located in semi-arid or dry sub-humid climatic conditions, then the leaving of rock fragments in the field is of high importance for soil and water conservation. An amount of more than 20 percent of rock fragments on the soil surface is highly efficient in protecting soil and water.\nThe purpose  of the technology is to conserve soil water from evaporation and to reduce soil loss under heavy rainfalls. The technology can be established in areas with soils formed on consolidated parent materials such as limestone, shale, conglomerates, etc. The benefit of the technology is the conservation of soil and water but the negative impact is the decrease of the effective soil depth which can be used by the growing plants. Land users usually do not like rock fragments in the field since they create problems during land cultivation activities. The technology is applied mainly in olive groves.COMMENTS:The application of technology depends on the presence in the soil of rock fragmentsSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Conservation practices|Nature-based solutions","type_id":"993, 1198, 1196","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 920, 918, 910, 914, 897, 898, 922","readiness_level":"7.

Difficult and distant access to water exhausts the animals, reducing production of meat and milk and reproductive capacities by up to 50%.\nBy providing water points in pastures, negative effects on livestock productivity can be reduced to a minimum. In order to implement the technology, water sources with perennial flow have to be identified with the shortest possible distance to and from the different grazing grounds. As a next step, in Tajikistan, water and land ownership and user rights must be regulated. Rights to pasture users are either given by the community or individual land and water owners. If the water source and a location for construction are found within a reasonable distance of the different pasture grounds, a drinking water system for livestock can be designed and constructed. Construction involves spring water collection , laying of pipes\nand finally installation of the water point. Besides the direct benefits (i.e. increased productivity and reproduction), the water points in the pastures reduce erosion from cattle tracks in often critical locations such as steep slopes surrounding springs. Water points also protect springs from being destroyed or spoiled by the animals. Thus the technology has a risk reduction benefit.

Wild cardamom planting take place in traditional agroforestry systems based on shifting agriculture. The objectives of this technologies are to reach sustainable forest use and to generate household income.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Bounthanom BouahomWild cardamom (Amomum subulatum) is a non-timber forest product (NTFP) that grows naturally in South Asia at elevations between 600 and 1.200 meters under the canopy of humid tropical forests (average temperature between 15-25 \u00b0C, PH level between 5,5- 6,5). In Laos, completely wild cardamom is still found in mountainous secondary forest at an elevation upwards of 700 meters, mainly near watercourses. In the past, it was commonly found by local people but never harvested or used. However, the international demand for cardamom began in 2000, and increased dramatically since then. This encouraged an increasing number of local villagers to collect cardamom from natural forest areas for sale to generate income for their households. This, however, caused depletion of cardamom in forest areas and also created conflicts among the people. Hence, the village people started to collect cardamom seedlings from the forest to cultivate them in their own upland fields, where farmers used to have upland rice cultivation before. Normally after rice harvest, they planted wild cardamom seedlings and led them grow up thogether with other wild plants and trees. It was treated as a kind of fallow. As a result of the domestication they were able to save time compared to the collection of wild cardamom in the forest. In 2002 it is estimated that two third of the harvest came from plantations. Cardamom cultivation on former fallow fields does not require significant investments \u2013 only hoes, knifes, and bags for collecting natural cardamom seedlings. One hectare of land requires around 15 days of seedling collection in the forest. The selected seedlings should reach an appropriate maturity (dark green leaves with 1 to 2 yellow leaves, height of stem about 1 to 2 meters) that promotes stem production, ensures high survival rate during transportation, and tolerates new environmental conditions at the planting site. Then, cardamom seedlings need to be replanted at latest two days after collection in the prepared plot. Typically, people plant cardamom during June \u2013 July with the beginning of wet season. Before in May, bush clearance is needed, but higher trees should be preserved at approximately 40 percent to provide a canopy for the required shadow to the cardamom. Vegetation removal necessitates observation and background knowledge of the individual land user. Cardamom planting should be established in lines and rows as follow: the space between the rows is 1 meter and 1.2 meters between the lines. The planting holes for the cardamom seedlings are 20 x 20 cm and 10 to 15 centimetres in depth. The space between the plants is 2 x 2 m, which facilitates the accessibility during weeding, maintenance, and harvest. It is recommended that farmers should plant three seedlings per hole. On average, there will be 2,500 holes\/ha that requires a total of 7,500 seedlings per hectare. After that, fertile soil should be applied to refill the holes by moderate feet pressure at the end. Most farmers don\u2019t use manure or fertilizers in their cardamom cultivations. Maintenance requires mainly the thinning of some tree branches to provide adequate sunlight as required by the cardamom plants. This can be implemented once a year after harvest. Cardamom plants provide fruits within four years after planting. During the establishment period till the first harvest the farmer\u2019s workload increases as they have to collect still wild cardamom in the forests as well. Harvesting can be carried out annually during August \u2013 September with an average production of 320 kg per hectare for dried cardamom and approximately 578 kg of fresh cardamom. The market demand for this kind of cardamom is high, because it is internationally requested as medicinal product. Therefore, the local people are satisfied with the selling price offered by middle men who buy the production at 70,000 Kip\/kg. Benefits from cardamom plantation include more income for local people, increase in forest cover, stabilization of slash and burn shifting cultivation and less impacts on agricultural lands. In addition, cardamom plantations help balancing the ecosystem and provide natural habitats for various animal and plant species.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Ground preparation and management machinery|Harvesting and processing equipment|Nature-based solutions|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic","type_id":"993, 1188, 1191, 1192, 1196, 1206, 1076","use_cases":"Production|forest products and logging management|Farm management|income increase|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|crop production|climate change adaptation|forestry management","use_cases_id":"897, 901, 910, 1180, 917, 916, 898, 918, 927","readiness_level":"7.

Three plots, 50m wide and 350m long were left in-between the trees to intercrop with lucerne and other perennial herbs. Thus, the total area which includes the shelterbelts, meadows and irrigation ditches makes up nearly 10 ha. The shelterbelt was established perpendicular to the direction of the strong winds. Past trials have shown that under the harsh climatic conditions of the Pamir region, shelterbelts in sandy and pebbly areas should include at least eight rows of trees and shrubs.\nPurpose of the Technology: The purpose of this technology was to intercrop the shelterbelts with lucerne in order to help protect crops from wind erosion.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Shelterbelts were planted by hand, not using any machinery. Trees and shrubs were planted in accordance with their physiological characteristics and their tolerance to deflation. The eight rows were planted in the following order: 1st row: sea-buckthorn, 2nd: Shugnan willows, 3rd: Thuran willows, 4th:  Pamir poplars, 5th: Bolle\u0027s poplars, 6th: Wilhelm\u2019s willows, 7th: Shugnan willows and 8th: Sea Buckthorn. The distance between trees in each row was 4m. Willows and poplars were planted as cuttings, around 1.5\u20133m in length cut off at the point at which the diameter of the base was around 6cm. Sea buckthorn was planted as seeds at a depth of 4-6cm. Horizontal planting, which increases the growth by 25%, was used instead of vertical planting. The trees were planted between late March and early April. Furrow irrigation ditches were dug before the actual planting of the trees. The irrigation ditches were 0.3m deep and 0.5m wide. The plot was then watered before the actual planting of the trees and the Lucerne, to increase the soil moisture and improve the subsequent growth of the trees. Further watering of the area was carried out every 4-7 days depending on the weather conditions and levels of moisture in the soil. These willow and poplar trees can be pruned 5-6 years after the initial planting. At this stage the branches will be 1-3 m long and can be used by the local population.\nNatural \/ human environment: The plot is located in an arid zone which has sandy and pebbly soil with low fertility. Initially this area was covered by Tugai forest and used as grazing land as well as for timber production. However, as a result of deforestation, the land in this area has become highly unstable and poses a threat to the irrigated lands upslope. 80% of the soil consists of stones and sand. Vegetation cover is mainly composed of sagebrush deserts. These shelterbelts were established during Soviet times and when the civil war broke out after independence, many of the poplar trees were cut down by the local population for construction- and firewood. Therefore only parts of the original shelterbelts are still in place today.COMMENTS:Boundary points of the Technology area: 36.40.46 - 71.47.28       36.40.37 - 71.47.26     36.4051 - 71.47.01    36.40.36 - 71.47.02\nTotal area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.1 km2.\nabout 10 haMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): land loss, soil fertility decrease, desertification of the area, poverty,\nMajor land use problems (land users\u2019 perception): land degradation, land fertility decrease, deforestation, poverty\nPlantation forestry: Yes\nForest products and services: fuelwood, fruits and nuts, grazing \/ browsing, nature conservation \/ protection, protection against natural hazards\nFuture (final) land use (after implementation of SLM Technology): Forests \/ woodlands: Fp: Plantations, afforestations\nLivestock is grazing on crop residuesSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1206","use_cases":"Production|forest products and logging management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|forestry management|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|Farm management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|crop production|animal production|pastoralists\u0026#039; animal production|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 901, 916, 927, 917, 918, 921, 910, 915, 898, 899, 1186, 1180","readiness_level":"7.

A large part of Uzbekistan also falls under a cold winter desert regime with extremely cold winters, hot summers and a dry climate. These conditions are being exacerbated because of climate change. The temperatures vary between (approximately) -20 and 40 degrees Celsius for winter and summer respectively. In addition to these harsh temperatures, there is little precipitation in the rainfed landscapes, with average annual rainfall varying between 100 and 200 millimetres. The extreme environment results in di\ufb03cult conditions for agricultural production in rainfed areas, because most plants are not able to grow during winter due to low temperatures and non-optimally used, scarce, rainfall during that period. In addition, land is degraded due to the continuous mono-cropping of cereals. This has led to the depletion of soil organic matter and soil nutrients and will lead to a soil unsuitable for crop cultivation.\nThe International Centre of Agriculture Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) recognized this problem and conducted research into improved varieties that can cope with the extreme temperatures in winter. These improved varieties were then shared with national partners, who evaluated them. Chickpeas are considered to be a promising crop, because firstly, they are leguminous with a high protein content. Legumes have the benefit of fixing atmospheric nitrogen into the soil. This is important since the soil is becoming exhausted due to continuous cultivation of cereals. Secondly, by planting chickpeas in autumn, the rainfall that falls in winter can be efficiently used. Thirdly, chickpeas planted in autumn, complete their life cycle before the heatwaves in summer and thus can be harvested easily.\nFurthermore, farmers benefit because the chickpeas increase net income, compared to cereal production. This is thanks to the higher rainfall e\ufb03ciency, improved soil conditions and avoided heatwaves. Originally, farmers planted regular chickpeas in the early spring, missing valuable winter rain. They were forced to plant in this period because the traditional chickpea varieties would not survive low winter temperatures. Additionally, sowing was often postponed because the soil was too wet due to snow melt. Improved chickpeas, sown in autumn, yield up to 50% more than the spring-sown chickpeas - reaching a yield up to two tonnes per hectare. Besides economic profitability, soil health has improved due to nitrogen fixation. In turn, this translates into higher profits because less nitrogen fertilizer is required.\nThe fields are prepared in October, the chickpeas are sown and fertilizer is applied. In March, the fields are weeded. Finally, the winter chickpeas are harvested, threshed and cleaned between May and June.  In this documentation, manual weeding and manual harvesting are described because on many small farms and households most activities rely on family labour. However, winter chickpeas may also be harvested and weeded by machine, reducing costs.\nInformation and data presented is partly made available through the project Collaborative Research Project on Sustainable Soil Management to Enhance Agricultural Productivity in Central Asia funded by IFPRI within the framework of Russian Federation funding to CGIAR.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques","type_id":"993, 994, 1199, 1196, 1203","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|Farm management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|field management|income increase|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 910, 912, 914, 1180, 915, 916, 918, 921, 922","readiness_level":"7.

Uzbekistan is no exception to this. Its temperatures vary between -20 and 40 degrees Celsius and precipitation is limited to less than 400 millimetres. This results in difficult conditions for farmers to ensure agricultural production and food security.\nWinter wheat is commonly grown to achieve food security and farm income as it is suited to the environment. However, the continuous cultivation of winter wheat has led to severe soil degradation and depletion, through extraction of soil organic matter and soil nutrients. Inevitably, this makes the soil unsuitable for crop cultivation. \nThe International Centre of Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) anticipated this challenge, and introduced improved mung bean varieties in 2014. Mung bean (or \u0022green gram\u0022: Vigna radiata) is a leguminous crop, which replenishes soil organic matter and fertility through nitrogen fixation. By including mung bean in the winter wheat production system, soil health is improved, fallow period reduced, and farmer incomes are increased. The increased farm income is due to the reduced amount of fertilizer required, increased yields and higher selling prices.\nMung bean realizes a profit of roughly 2000 USD per hectare in a period of 100 days, while winter wheat profits are approximately 600 USD per hectare in an eight month period. These numbers show the significant benefit of incorporating mung bean. Scientist have demonstrated that cultivating only mung bean would lead to even higher profit margins, but concluded that adoption is unrealistic as wheat is pre-dominantly grown for food security.\nThe incorporation of mung bean in the agricultural production system has one downside and that is increased irrigation demand, because mung bean requires additional water. \nThe mung bean-winter wheat-system follows the following crop rotation. The field for mung bean is tilled and harrowed, prior to seeding. Mung bean is mechanically seeded and manually harvested in  June-July and September-October respectively. In this growing period, the field is weeded either manually or by a cultivator, irrigated, fertilizer mechanically applied or hand broadcast and mechanically weeded.\nWinter wheat is mechanically planted in October, after the field is harrowed. In March-April, the wheat crops are treated with chemicals and fertilizers. In June-July, the winter wheat is mechanically harvested. Winter wheat also receives irrigation through a canal. \nTo conclude, this documentation shows that smart ICARDA crop choice with improved varieties extremely benefits local farmers incomes and adds resilience. It also reduces land degradation within a commonly used production system.\nData presented in this work is partly made available through CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems; Collaborative Research Project on Sustainable Soil Management to Enhance Agricultural Productivity in Central Asia funded by IFPRI within the framework of Russian Federation funding to CGIAR (2018-2019); CGIAR Collaborative Research \u0026amp; Capacity Building Program for the Development of Sustainable and Resilient Agricultural Production in Central Asia within the framework of Russian Federation Funding (2013-2016).COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Biotechnologies|Nature-based solutions|Selective breeding practices (non-biotech)|Institutional|Research and education function","type_id":"993, 994, 1196, 1199, 1116, 1132","use_cases":"Production|crop production|improved plant varieties|Farm management|income increase|field management|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability|soil carbon sequestration monitoring","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 902, 910, 1180, 914, 912, 915, 916, 921, 918, 920, 922","readiness_level":"7.

The technology allows for good air circulation which is essential for drying out the maize grains. In this way the grain quality is improved.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  PRISCILLA VIVIAN KYOSABAThe technology is suitable for farmers growing maize on medium to large scale for commercial purposes. It was adopted from Europe by a farmer in Kamwenge District to help in handling large quantities of maize harvests from a 50-acre farm, which is the largest piece of land under maize farming in the area. Most operations on the farm e.g. land preparation, planting, weeding, spraying and harvesting are semi mechanized. Maize harvest from the farm averages about 2,000 tons per season. This requires a reliable post- harvest handling system that can store the large volumes of maize grain safely with good quality for the market.\nThe storage cribs are constructed with a wire mesh which is bent to form a rectangular shape to allow more space for storage. The wire mesh structure is then placed on a wooden platform raised a 1 meter above the ground. The whole system is then protected from elements of weather by an iron sheet roof raised 3 meters away from the platform. In front of the structure is a floor space where the harvested maize is first spread on a tarpaulin for sun drying to reduce the moisture content that may be a source of mould leading to grain spoilage and reduces grain quality.\nThe crib is suitable for storage of maize cobs in both the humid and dry seasons in the Kamwenge area. The structure is well positioned with the longer side in a direction perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction thus facilitating natural ventilation. This allows the drying process to continue even during storage and minimises the possibility of post harvest losses through spoilage.\nThe storage life greatly depends on the prevailing ambient temperature and relative humidity, and other factors like the inherent moisture pests and diseases.  The rectangular shape allows for more space for storage and the material used is durable to beyond 7 years if repairs are done in time. Yet, despite these advantages, the wide open wire mesh allows in birds which feed on the maize which brings about losses.\nEstablishment cost of the maize storage crib is mainly determined by the construction materials and size. The farmer reported using US$ 4,191.7 in total to establish the structural size of 30 m length, 12 m height and 3 m width .  Maintenance activities included repairing the damaged patches on the crib plus also fumigating the units to prevent insects from damaging the poles and eating harvested maize which costs the farmer about US$ 54.8 per season.The costs involved in establishing the technology  are slightly higher in the short run while in the long run the net benefits surpass the initial costs.  This system is best suited for farmers practising commercial maize farming. However, small scale farmers may be able to construct small size storage cribs using cheaper materials like reeds, bamboo and wood.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Harvesting and processing equipment","type_id":"993, 1188, 1192","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Supply chain management|support to post-harvest handling and aggregation|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for economic benefit|forecasting, planning of planting and harvesting","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 939, 942, 910, 914, 915, 912","readiness_level":"7.

The reservoir has a maximum capacity of 8,000 liters of water; clean enough for irrigation, livestock and domestic use during seasons of scarcity. The reservoir is raised off of ground to minimize contamination and any possible accidents.\n","long_description":"Compiler:  Aine AmonThe wooden water reservoir system was introduced to the farmer by staff of the area\u0027s local government as a demonstration site to educate others on how to cheaply harvest and store rainwater in a relatively clean form for domestic, livestock and irrigation use. The farmer\u2019s house was fitted with gutters to tap rainwater and direct it into the water reservoir. The water collected is used to buffer the water scarcity during the dry season, which normally stresses livestock and crops in the area. The water can be stored for as long as three months, depending on the size of the water reservoir and the use of the water.\nThe establishment of the technology requires a clean roof for collecting rainwater, gutters, poles, iron sheets, tarpaulin, hose pipe, jerry can and nails. Further equipment required include; a hammer, hoe and panga (large knife for weeding and forest works). At the farm in Kyegegwa, the reservoir is constructed 3 meters away from the farmer\u2019s main house located at the top of a gently sloping hill. The establishment process involves: leveling of the site on which the technology is planned and constructing a water reservoir supported by a wooden structure. The support structure is constructed using four poles made in such a way that the two front poles are taller (5m) while the two poles behind are shorter (3m). This will give the roof a slight slope to prevent rainwater from stagnating on the roof. A raised rectangular floor supported by the poles is then established at a height of 0.5m above ground. The rectangular reservoir base dimensions are 1m\u00d74m\u00d72m (h\u00d7l\u00d7w) and is divided into 4 compartment. Each of these, lined with water-tight tarpaulin, can hold 2000 litres of water. The water so collected in the reservoir can be extracted under gravity through a 1.5cm diameter hose pipe into a jerry can placed below the reservoir.\nThe cost of establishment and durability of this rainwater harvesting system is mainly dependent on the type of materials and gutters used. In Kyegegwa District, wood for construction of the system is locally available valued at US$ 67.99 for the construction of the reservoir system. The iron sheets, gutters and nails are acquired from Kyegegwa Town where they are valued at US$ 127.28. The labor required is also locally available where it takes four men to establish the structure at a total cost of US$ 17.95 in three days.\nThe water reservoir is semi-permanent and can last for about 1.5 years depending on the quality of materials used. The maintenance activities include cleaning of the reservoir every month and repairing of the worn out parts at the end of the wet season. The farmer strongly recommends the technology since most of the materials and labour used are relatively cheap and locally available. The reservoir is raised off the ground to reduce contamination and minimize possible accidents with children and livestock. Despite the open space above the water level and the roof, the farmer has observed that the reservoir does not breed obnoxious vectors like mosquitoes. The water collected is relatively clean and the farmer uses it for irrigation of home gardens and for watering of livestock. When properly filtered it is as well used for domestic purposes. The technology can be improved by using treated poles, stronger wood material and tarpaulin of improved quality.COMMENTS:The project is located at the top of a gently sloping hillSOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Nature-based solutions|Drought-resistant techniques|Traditional and indigenous practices|Social and socio-economic|Frugal innovation","type_id":"993, 1188, 1196, 1203, 1206, 1076, 1088","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|water use optimization for sustainability|Production|animal production|crop production|Farm management|disaster management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|optimization of resource use for economic benefit","use_cases_id":"916, 920, 897, 899, 898, 910, 1154, 914, 909, 915","readiness_level":"7.

To overcome this challenge, farmers maintain blocks of natural vegetation around their plantations. In the case of this technology, the farmer has maintained natural vegetation around his banana plantation. Within the plantation there are other crops such as vegetables. The trees in the natural vegetation provide shade to the crops and act as wind breaks to the banana plantation.\nThe size of the plantation is approximately 2 acres. On either side of the plantation is a strip of natural vegetation with a variety of trees species but mainly drought-tolerant species such as Cobretum molle, Albizia coriaria and Accia seyal. Under these trees are grasses which are some times used for livestock. The distance between the banana plantation and the natural woodland is approximately 3 meters and the natural vegetation is approximately 5 meters wide. During the dry season the tall grass from the natural vegetation, if not used for livestock, is harvested and used as mulch in the banana plantation. This also serves to reduce the fire hazard that may spread from the natural vegetation into the plantations. It is also from the farmer\u0027s natural vegetation that sometimes poles are cut and used to support heavy bunches of growing bananas. \nGenerally, the technology does not require a lot of inputs, since bananas are a perennial crop requiring no regular purchase of seeds\/seedlings. The major inputs that require regular supply are grass mulch and manure. The farmer usually gets the grass mulch from the natural woodland next to the bananas. He obtains the manure from either of his five cows in the Kraal or purchases additional animal manure from neighbors. On average the farmer adds three tons of manure each year and about a ton of mulch per year. The advantage is that mulch also decomposes easily and adds to the soil carbon and therefore the fertility of the soil. The labor for the work in the plantation is mainly household-based.\nTo be able to maintain his technology, the farmers need to have adequate labor to maintain a clear separation between the banana plantation and the natural woodland. The farmers also requires labor to manage the grass in the natural woodland so that it does not out grow to pose a fire risk and provide habitat for other dangerous animals like snakes and rodents. \nThis technology is suitable in areas where grazing is not a major farming activity because livestock can easily cross from the woodland into the banana plantation and destroy it in a very short time.COMMENTS:SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Living barriers|Traditional and indigenous practices|Drought-resistant techniques|Integrated management systems|Species diversification","type_id":"993, 1196, 1210, 1206, 1203, 1197, 1200","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Farm management|field management|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|climate change adaptation|improving soil management practices|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 910, 914, 916, 918, 921, 922, 917","readiness_level":"7.

They are mainly established and managed on individual basis. Grevillea Robusta and Eucalyptus trees are the main tree species used for woodlots in Embu District.  Fast-growing and coppicing species are best for woodlot establishment.\nPurpose of the Technology: Woodlots are mainly used for provision of firewood, timber and building materials. Woodlots also prevent soil erosion through their thick mulch and roots that hold the soil together. Other benefits of woodlots includes provision of cool weather, air purification or windbreakers. They are well protected, especially during the first years after establishment.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: Farmers in Embu district normally obtain healthy plants is by using seedlings from their individual or  local nurseries. The nurseries should be set 6-10 weeks before the start of the rainy season. The plants must be transferred to the fields in the early rainy season. The trees can be planted after a shallow ploughing (seeds) or in planting pits (seedlings). Spacing changes according to the purpose, 2 x 2 m or 2 x 4 m are common options. Management should be particularly careful in the first years. Weeding should be carried out 2-3 times in the first 2 years in order to avoid competition with weeds and reduce pests\u2019 infestations. The area must be closed to grazing animals for the first few\nyears.

In these areas, conserving soil and water by cheap technologies that could be installed by the farmers with available resources and knowledge becomes important.\nPurpose of the Technology: Woven wood fences represent a technology applied and demonstrated successful in semi-arid mountainous dry croplands in Eski\u015fehir, central Anatolia. They consist of wooden posts 150 cm height inserted into the ground and branches woven between these posts. Eroded soil from upslope becomes trapped on the upslope side of the fence and overland flow is decreased. The distance between the fences is determined with respect to soil texture and field gradient. It is 30 m in hillslopes of 10% gradient covered by sandy loams in the Eski\u015fehir region.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The basic costs are for the materials, its transportation and the labour involved in installation. The posts and branches are derived either from trees on the farmers\u2019 fields or from nearby state-owned forests. For 2009, the cost of installation was about 1350 US$\/ha. The maintenance costs of this medium-term (20 years) technology are only the labour needed to repair the damaged fences\/terraces after extreme rainfalls. Technological change includes contour (rather than downslope) tillage between the fences, which causes a minor increase (10%) in the expenses of tillage operations.\nNatural \/ human environment: The technology can be applied both by small- and large-scale farmers in quite different soil and slope gradient conditions. Results indicate that crop yield doubles (1300 kg\/ha of barley) and soil loss apparently diminishes using this technology.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 0.0115 km2.Major land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): The current dry cropland use requires the fields to be fallow every second year due to insufficient water in the soil. For this reason drought radically decreases crop yield. Owing to heavy rainfall, removal of both topsoil and subsoil occurs in places causing increased stoniness in the soil, which decreases its fertility and makes the tillage operations difficult.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|Production|crop production|disaster management|climate change adaptation|water use optimization for sustainability","use_cases_id":"916, 921, 910, 914, 897, 898, 1154, 918, 920","readiness_level":"7.

It involves digging planting pits with a diameter of at least 30 to 40 cm and 10 to 15 cm deep. They are spaced 70 to 80 cm apart, resulting in around 10,000 pits per hectare. Staggered rows of holes are dug perpendicularly to the slope. The earth dug out of the hole is piled up to form a small ridge around the rim, which captures water. A couple of handfuls of organic fertiliser or compost are put into each pit. They are normally made in the dry season before the first rains start. However, it is recommended that the pits be made immediately after the rainy season, when the soil is still moist and the weather is not too hot. If the pits are in place early in the dry season, they act as traps during the windy period in February and March, retaining rich dust carried by the harmattan and wind-blown organic matter. At least 3 tonnes of compost per hectare is recommended.\nPurpose of the Technology: The arrangement of the pits in staggered rows ensures the most efficient collection of rainwater and slows the flow of water over the surface. The zai technique concentrates and conserves nutrients and water near the roots of the plants grown in them. The application of organic fertiliser directly around the plants is an economical use of a factor of production to which most farmers have limited access. It also reactivates biological activity, increases fertility and loosens the soil.\nAs zai planting pits restore degraded, uncultivated land, they lessen the pressure to clear other land for farming. They also reduce the vulnerability of plants during dry spells and droughts, ensuring crop production and improving food security.\nPlots with zai planting pits (with fertiliser) average yields of 409 kg of millet grain per hectare, compared to 195 kg per hectare registered on control plots. Millet yields can therefore be doubled with this technique.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The zai technique requires high labour input. It is estimated that between 40 and 60 man-days per hectare are required, depending on the density of the pits. There is a mechanised system for making the holes, using a special animal-drawn plough, which considerably reduces the number of man-days required to 7 per hectare.\nIf the pits are prepared each year or once every two years (using the same pits or making new ones in the spaces between the old ones), soil fertility is restored and the crop cycle can be resumed. The application of organic fertiliser in sufficient quantities enables the plot to be cultivated sustainably. After five years, it can be farmed in the normal way.\nCovering extensive areas with zai planting pits requires a high level of community mobilisation and effective organisation and logistics. Apart from this, the technique is very simple to implement and easily mastered by the farmers.\nNatural \/ human environment: Zai planting pits are used on marginal or degraded land that is no longer cultivated, such as low-gradient pediments and land with encrusted soil in areas with rainfall levels of less than 800 mm a year. They are not recommended for sandy soils, as they are not stable when dug in this type of soil, or for valley bottoms, where they risk being flooded. Zai planting pits are particularly useful in areas where land use pressure is high, as they permit the rehabilitation of unproductive land for farming.\nFrom the point of view of climate change adaptation, zai planting pits are particularly useful in areas with erratic or low rainfall, as they prevent the loss of water. As the fertiliser is placed inside the pits, it is not washed away by heavy rain.COMMENTS:Major cash crop: Ground nut\nMajor food crop: Millet\nMajor other crops: Sorghum, cow pea and mangos\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): soil erosion, fertility decline, aridification, loss of limited rainwater by runoff\nType of cropping system and major crops comments: farmers are mainly agropastoralists with some communities specialised on pure pastoralism\nConstraints of forested government-owned land or commons\nType of grazing land: Extensive grazing: Nomadism, semi-nomadism\/pastoralism.

In the predominantly annual cropping system communities, free grazing livestock often damage crops and are a major cause of conflict. On the other hand, farmers observe that crop yields have declined season after season.  For example, the bunch of bananas has grown smaller, it has smaller fingers, and many banana stands have no fruit during much of the year.  The most important ways through which croplands in Rubagano are degraded include nutrient transfer through harvest and crop residue movement and use; nutrient mining whereby continuous cultivation is done with little or no replenishment; and soil and water runoff on steep slopes.  Farmers know that one of the most important ways to reverse declining soil fertility is to apply manure, but it is expensive. Therefore farmers acquired goats or pigs primarily for the provision of manure for their cropland, but also as a household income generating enterprise.  In stall-fed goat or pig production, The zero-grazing unit is designed in such a way that it is well ventilated and protected from wind, rain and constant direct sunshine to avoid livestock developing coughs, colds and stress.  The unit has 3 major parts: the feeding and rest area, the exercise area and the manure collection area. The feeding\/rest area is raised 1 m above the ground. Below it is the manure collection area and above it, a corrugated iron roof.  There is a feeding vat on each side of the feeding\/rest area in which mixed fodder is fed to the livestock. A wooden food preparation slab for cutting and mixing fodder is in front of the feeding\/rest area. The unit for housing 12 goats is 4 m by 8 m on the ground and 3 m high at the feeding area.\nPurpose of the Technology: The major objective of stall-feeding is to maximize manure collection for sustaining soil fertility in cropland. Other goals are to improve household income, reduce expenditure on pests and disease management through livestock isolation from other animals and to reduce labor by cutting and storing fodder for use over a period instead of grazing in distant pastures daily.\nEstablishment \/ maintenance activities and inputs: The materials required for establishment of the zero-grazing unit for goats are wooden posts or poles, cut-off planks, wooden slats\/timber, iron sheets and nails. The 4 m by 4 m feeding\/rest area is raised 1 m above the ground on strong Eucalyptus or pine posts of diameter 5-10 cm.  Its wall is 2 m high and is made of widely spaced cut-off planks or light wooden poles not more than 3 cm diameter nailed to strong upright posts.  The floor is made of wooden slats placed 2 cm apart, big enough to allow livestock droppings to fall through but too small for adult goats\u2019 or kids\u2019 hooves pass, in order to avoid injury to livestock. There is a 1.5 m by 0.5 m feeding vat on each side of the feeding\/rest area and a 1 m by 1 m fodder mixing wooden slab at the front.  On the ground to one side of the feeding\/rest area is the 4m by 4m exercise area.  The unit can be constructed at any time of the year.\nNatural \/ human environment: Regular maintenance of the unit is done to ensure the floor does not develop holes that can lead to injury of the livestock, and the roof does not leak when it rains.

The steep slopes, occupying 30-40% of the plateau area, have been heavily degraded by severe top soil and gully erosion. Over the whole Loess Plateau approximately 73,350 km2 of these erosion prone slopes have been conserved by terraces.\nIn the case study area (Zhuanglang County) the land that is suitable for terracing has been completely covered. The total terraced area is 1,088 km2, accounting for 90% of the hillsides. The terraces were constructed manually, starting at the bottom of the slopes and proceeding from valley to the ridge. The terraces comprise a riser of earth, with vertical or steeply sloping sides and an approximately flat bed (level bench). Depending on farmers preference some terrace beds are edged by a raised lip (a small earth ridge) which retains rainwater, others remain without lip. The semi-arid climate does not require a drainage system. For typical hillside terraces on slopes of 25-35% the bed width is about 3.5-5 metres with a 1-2 metre riser, involving moving about 2,000-2,500 cubic metres of soil (see table of technical specifications). Generally the risers are not specifically protected, but there may be some natural grasses growing on the upper part. The lower part of the riser is cut vertically into the original soil surface, and has no grass cover, being dry and compact. However it is not erosion-prone since it has a stable structure.\nOver most of the Loess Plateau, the soil is very deep and therefore well suited to terrace construction. In addition to downstream benefits, the purpose is to create a better environment for crop production through improved moisture conservation, and improved ease of farming operations. In an average rainfall year, crop yields on terraced land are more than three times higher than they used to be on unterraced, sloping land. The implication is that terrace construction - though labour intensive - pays back in only three to four years when combined with agronomic improvements (such as applying farm yard manure and planting green manure). Some farmers try to make the best use of the upper part of terrace risers by planting cash trees or forage crops - including Hippophae rhamnoides (seabuckthorn), Caragana korshinskii (peashrub) and some leguminous grass. This is locally termed \u2018terrace bund economy\u2019. The plants stabilise the risers and at the same time provides extra benefits.COMMENTS:Total area covered by the SLM Technology is 1080 km2.major cash crops: peas\nmajor food crops: wheat, maize, potato, millet, sorghum\nperrenial tree and shrub cropping: apple, pear and peach; walnut\nMajor land use problems (compiler\u2019s opinion): Cultivation of unterraced hillside slopes leads to serious soil erosion and problems of downstream sedimentation.\nLoss of topsoil and rainwater in uncontrolled runoff has contributed to declining crop yields.SOURCES:\n","type":"Technological|Nature-based solutions|Conservation practices|Traditional and indigenous practices","type_id":"993, 1196, 1198, 1206","use_cases":"Production|crop production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|Farm management|field management|optimization of resource use for better production|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag|water use optimization for sustainability|climate change adaptation|income increase","use_cases_id":"897, 898, 916, 921, 910, 914, 909, 917, 920, 918, 1180","readiness_level":"9.
