🌱 ATIO Food Systems Decision Intelligence Platform
A React-based web application built for the ATIO Hackathon, designed to support data-driven, inclusive decision-making in food systems through persona-based dashboards and an AI-powered chatbot.

🚀 Project Overview
The ATIO Food Systems Decision Intelligence Platform enables stakeholders in the agrifood ecosystem to access insights, explore data, and make informed decisions even in contexts where data is incomplete or fragmented.

The platform aligns with the objectives of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Agrifood Systems Technologies and Innovations Outlook (ATIO) by transforming food systems knowledge into actionable, explainable outcomes.

🎯 Key Objectives
Support evidence-based decision-making

Enable persona-specific experiences

Promote inclusive and grassroots-friendly innovation

Provide AI-assisted insights through a chatbot interface

Demonstrate a scalable and modular frontend architecture

👥 Supported User Personas
👩🏽‍🌾 Farmer
Simplified insights

Visual and practical recommendations

Climate and productivity guidance

📊 Researcher
Data exploration and comparison

Indicator-focused views

Structured datasets

🏛 Policymaker
Policy-relevant summaries

Evidence briefs

High-level system indicators

Each persona receives a customized dashboard tailored to their decision needs.

🧠 Core Features
⚛️ React JSX Frontend

🎭 Persona-based dashboards

📊 FAO-aligned food systems datasets (JSON/CSV)

🤖 AI-powered chatbot (RAG-ready integration)

🌱 Agriculture-friendly, accessible UI design

🧩 Modular and scalable component architecture

🤖 AI Chatbot Integration
The platform includes a floating chatbot widget that allows users to ask food systems–related questions.

Chatbot Capabilities:
Context-aware responses

Integration-ready for RAG pipelines

Designed for non-technical users

Supports exploratory and decision-focused queries

⚠️ The frontend consumes the chatbot API; AI reasoning and retrieval logic are handled on the backend.

🎨 UI & Design Principles
Nature-inspired, agricultural-friendly color palette

WCAG-conscious contrast and accessibility

Mobile-responsive layout

Visual-first presentation for low cognitive load

Design Philosophy:

Simple enough for farmers, powerful enough for policymakers.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React (JSX)

Styling: CSS / Tailwind (optional)

State Management: React Hooks & Context

Data Handling: JSON / CSV

AI Integration: REST-based chatbot API

📌 Hackathon Scope & Limitations
Prototype-level implementation

Mocked or sample datasets where required

Focus on clarity, usability, and explainability

Designed for demo-readiness, not production deployment

🤝 Team & Collaboration
This project is developed collaboratively as part of the ATIO Hackathon, with clear separation of responsibilities across frontend, backend, AI, and impact roles.

🌍 Impact Vision
By bridging data, AI, and human-centered design, this platform demonstrates how food systems knowledge can be transformed into inclusive, actionable intelligence that supports sustainable agrifood transformation.
