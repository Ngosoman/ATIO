Meanwhile, the region\u0027s dependence on biomass for energy creates environmental and supply chain risks due to deforestation.Biochar presents a business opportunity to deliver value-added products and services that tackle both soil health and sustainable energy use. As a soil enhancer, it increases nutrient retention and fertilizer efficiency, helping farmers maximize yields and reduce costs. As a carbon-rich material, it aligns with green investment and carbon market initiatives. Investing in biochar solutions opens the door to scalable, climate-smart agri-business models.\n","long_description":"Biochar, a powerfully circular way to fight climate change\n","type":"","type_id":"","use_cases":"climate change mitigation|soil carbon sequestration monitoring|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices|improving soil management practices|biodiversity preservation, agroecology, conservation ag","use_cases_id":"919, 922, 916, 921, 917","readiness_level":"8.

The rising cost of feed, which makes up 60-70% of total production expenses, adds to this problem. At the same time, about 30-40% of food produced today is lost or wasted, leading to large amounts of organic waste and animal manure that harm the environment if not properly managed. The traditional way of producing and consuming goods also creates issues for the economy, ecosystems, and society.To address these challenges, Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae composting offers a smart solution. This technology tackles two key problems: managing organic waste and reducing the high cost of animal feed in the region. BSF larvae turn organic waste into valuable protein feed for animals and nutrient-rich fertilizer, cutting down on waste sent to landfills and reducing environmental harm. The larvae are highly efficient at transforming organic by-products into protein-rich feed, providing a more sustainable option for fish and chicken farming. By reusing agricultural waste, BSF technology supports a circular economy that benefits both the environment and the economy.\n","long_description":"BSFL proteins for sustainable local fish and chicken feed production\n","type":"","type_id":"","use_cases":"Production|animal production|fisheries products management|Alternative food production|production of alternative protein sources (e.g. insect farming, meat substitutes)|optimization of resource use for better production|Natural resources management \u0026amp; sustainable practices","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 900, 934, 937, 909, 916","readiness_level":"8.

These peels, if not properly managed, create environmental hazards through uncontrolled dumping and burning. However, their potential as a valuable resource for rearing livestock and fish remains largely untapped.  Cassava peels have the potential to serve as an excellent source of feed and fiber for animals, but their utilization has been hindered by drying constraints, the risk of aflatoxin contamination, and poor storability when traditional methods are employed. The introduction of simple equipment to mechanize the conversion of cassava peels into animal feeds offers solutions to these challenges. This technology reduces labor costs, shortens drying times, and improves the shelf life of feed products. By effectively utilizing cassava peels as animal feed, smallholder farmers and agri-food manufacturers can enhance the value derived from their cassava crops and address the scarcity of nutritious animal feeds. Additionally, the mechanized processing of cassava peels into wet cakes and dry mashes presents opportunities for job creation and business development in rural areas of Africa. Overall, this technology not only mitigates environmental issues but also contributes to improving food security, livestock production, and economic prospects in the region.\n","long_description":"Affordable animal feed for breeders\n","type":"Technological|Mechanization|Animal management machinery","type_id":"993, 1188, 1195","use_cases":"Production|animal production|improved animal breeds|livestock monitoring|animal health","use_cases_id":"897, 899, 903, 905, 907","readiness_level":"7.

Their hardiness against common pests and tolerance for low water quality make them an attractive choice for aquaculture.  However, the scarcity of quality fingerlings from improved catfish breeds is a significant obstacle faced by local hatcheries. This scarcity hampers the efforts of fish farmers to increase yields, meet market demands, and improve returns. As a result, many farmers resort to collecting fish eggs from the wild or purchasing poor quality fingerlings, hindering the potential for increased production and economic benefits.

These carcinogenic substances are produced when food is exposed to smoke and high temperatures, and their presence in grilled and smoked products has raised significant public health concerns.Studies conducted in Benin country have revealed alarming levels of PAHs in smoked and grilled meats and fish, often exceeding international safety standards. This contamination is linked to the direct exposure of food to smoke, the type of fuel used (often wood), and the inefficient design of traditional processing equipment. The accumulation of PAHs not only poses a cancer risk to consumers but also hampers the marketability of these products in regions with stricter food safety regulations.Addressing this challenge requires innovations in food processing technologies that can reduce or eliminate the formation of PAHs while maintaining or improving the efficiency and productivity of the smoking and grilling process. The development of improved equipment, such as QualiSani, represents a significant step towards safer food processing practices.

The hermetic storage technology for grains avoids grain damage using sealed bags that prevents movement of air and moisture. The bags preserve the quality of grains and obstruct the entry of insects and microbial organisms through depletion of oxygen levels and accumulation of carbon dioxide.

This technology allows for the artificial ripening of bananas using various chemical agents, with ethylene gas being the most commonly employed. Commercial ripening chambers are utilized to precisely control temperature, humidity, and ethylene gas concentration, ensuring that bananas reach optimal ripeness. Catalytic generators are used to produce ethylene, and a concentration of 100 ppm for 12 hours can have an immediate ripening effect. Ethephon, another widely used compound, releases ethylene, which aids in the ripening process.This technology not only enhances the marketability of bananas by delivering consistently ripe and attractive fruit but also extends their shelf life. It allows for better inventory management, reduces post-harvest losses, and ultimately benefits the banana industry by meeting consumer demand for high-quality, ready-to-eat bananas.
